            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Courſe of Chymiſtry,</hi> to which this is an <hi>Appendix,</hi> was received ſo well, that I ſhall forbear uſing many reaſons, why I now cauſe this to be <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</hi> I am ſure all ſuch as have more in them of the <hi>Phyſician</hi> than <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> and whoſe deſigns are <hi>Truely</hi> and <hi>Methodically</hi> to <hi>Cure,</hi> by having laid a <hi>Solid Foundation</hi> for <hi>Phyſick</hi> by good <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and who do not expect as many <hi>Miracles</hi> from a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Salt,</hi> as ſome Women boaſt of from a ſimple Receipt for the <hi>Ague,</hi> or the like; ſuch <hi>Rational Phyſicians,</hi> I dare ſay, will gladly enough receive ſome hints of this <hi>Appendix.</hi> The <hi>Gentleman,</hi> though a <hi>Chymiſt</hi> to the purpoſe, and one that has ſpared no manner of pains to find out the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> yet is ſo extreamly <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,</hi> as to ſpeak of <hi>Chymical Remedies,</hi> like a third perſon unconcerned, any further than real truth lies at ſtake. He makes few <hi>Panegyricks</hi> of the <hi>Remedies</hi> herein, or before mentioned, and diſcourſes of them ſo, as to ſearch out their nature by nothing but <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and rejecting all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:55119:3"/>that his <hi>hand</hi> cannot <hi>touch,</hi> or his <hi>eye ſee.</hi> This preſent <hi>Supplement</hi> is the effect of his <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brain,</hi> ſince the firſt <hi>Edition</hi> of his <hi>Book,</hi> of which the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> was made, the <hi>Author</hi> having ſince ſent me two other <hi>Editions,</hi> out of which I have collected theſe <hi>Additions,</hi> for your further <hi>Curioſity.</hi> One thing particularly is here taken notice of, which I can never repent the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the being an inſtrument in making it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known; it is, that divers things do by <hi>Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> and <hi>Diſtillation</hi> not only receive an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fire, but even <hi>fiery parts</hi> into their compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a very great quantity, nay to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble augmentation of their <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you <hi>Calcine Lead</hi> in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> although you ſee a great many <hi>Vapours</hi> ariſe out of the matter during the <hi>Calcination,</hi> yet the <hi>Calx</hi> being at laſt weighed, will be found conſiderably heavier than the <hi>Lead</hi> was at firſt, which the wit of man can never explicate, but by admitting the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>fiery parts</hi> into the <hi>Calx, ſee p. 33, 34.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calcine</hi> four ounces of the common <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> ſtirring it all the while with a <hi>Spatule;</hi> there will riſe up a <hi>vapour</hi> for an hour and halfs time, or thereabouts, and when it fumes no longer, <hi>weigh</hi> it, and there will be two drachms and a half more than the <hi>Regulus weighed</hi> at firſt, <hi>ſee p. 60.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diſtil</hi> in a <hi>Retort</hi> the <hi>Burning Spirit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> out of <hi>Salt of Saturn,</hi> and let the <hi>Salt</hi> you <hi>diſtil</hi> be ſix ounces, you'l thence draw an ounce and ſix drachms of liquor, and there will remain in the <hi>Retort</hi> ſix ounces and ſix drachms of matter.
<pb facs="tcp:55119:3"/>Now nothing in nature can here make this <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>two ounces and a half,</hi> but the entrance of <hi>Fire,</hi> fire imbodied into the matter, <hi>ſee p. 35.</hi> of this <hi>Appendix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inſtances here mentioned may ſuffice to prove, how that ſubtil, dangerous, and too active Principle, <hi>Fire,</hi> does <hi>predominate</hi> in abundance of <hi>Remedies,</hi> that are commonly uſed. I ſhall add one word concerning the manner of the <hi>Diſtillation</hi> of <hi>Acid Spirits,</hi> by which we may the better gueſs at their <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Capacity.</hi> A <hi>Retort</hi> is placed ſo in a <hi>Furnace,</hi> that the <hi>Fire</hi> may <hi>Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate,</hi> or beat back again upon the veſſel, great fires are kindled, and continued for <hi>2, 3, 4</hi> dayes together, they are made as exceeding violent as <hi>Art</hi> can make them, the <hi>Retort</hi> and the <hi>Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> in it, if you look into the <hi>Furnace,</hi> do all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of a <hi>live coal,</hi> they turn into as true a fire as the <hi>Wood</hi> it ſelf, and there ſeems to be not the leaſt difference but in the <hi>Figure,</hi> and thus by the violent force of this moſt active, vigorous, ſearching, but <hi>deſtructive Principle, Fire,</hi> the <hi>acid Spirits</hi> are driven out into a large <hi>Receiver,</hi> in <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Red clouds,</hi> and there having room to play a while, they at laſt condenſe into <hi>fiery Spirits,</hi> or a <hi>ſpirituous fire.</hi> Theſe <hi>Spirits,</hi> when the veſſels are cold, are taken out, and ſtopt up carefully (hardly any thing but <hi>glaſs ſtopples</hi> will ſerve the turn) and though they are <hi>fixt Spirits,</hi> the fire contained in them will needs tend upwards, and afterwards, as occaſion ſerves, theſe nimble <hi>Spirits</hi> are not only uſed for <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> (which they do well for) but are given <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb facs="tcp:55119:4"/>inwardly,</hi> too too often, nay, by ſome <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Practiſers,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as love <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> ſo dearly, that they are in continual hopes of the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone,</hi> theſe ſame <hi>Spirits</hi> ſhall be given with as much freedom, and as little regret of <hi>Conſcience</hi> as a draught of <hi>Small beer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now does it not deſerve <hi>ſerious conſideration</hi> what theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> are made of, what is the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> taken <hi>inwardly,</hi> and what <hi>miraculous</hi> effects muſt needs happen from theſe elaborate, and ſo powerful remedies! <hi>Nature</hi> is a <hi>tender</hi> thing, and muſt be uſed very <hi>gently</hi> if you would help her, ſhe's a compoſition of <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> and uſes wonderful moderation in every thing ſhe does; offer her any thing injurious or diſtaſteful, and ſhe's never quiet till ſhe has thrown it off; a draught of <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>water</hi> will do her good to the very heart, when her functions are diſturb'd; and ſhe pants for burning heat. I know you may <hi>force</hi> her to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented with <hi>Acid, cooling,</hi> (and yet <hi>fiery</hi>) <hi>Spirits</hi> given in <hi>Juleps,</hi> or the like, but whether they are really agreeable and beneficial to <hi>Nature,</hi> we may have no ſmall reaſon to doubt.</p>
            <p>I know the common univerſal practice of the world now-a daies will plead more for <hi>Acids</hi> than any thing I can ſay againſt them. Yet this is plain to my underſtanding, that all <hi>Big-worded Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and ſuch as are moſt <hi>popular,</hi> have their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Fate,</hi> they have their <hi>beginning,</hi> their time of <hi>flouriſhing,</hi> and their <hi>Period.</hi> Once <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> was all in all, every body muſt be dropping it into their drink. Now 'tis almoſt forgot; other <hi>Maſter pieces</hi> in <hi>Quackery</hi> have come in its place.
<pb facs="tcp:55119:4"/>Who would have thought lately, that <hi>Rabels drops</hi> (ſuppoſed to be <hi>Oyl of Vitriol ſweetned</hi>) ſhould ſo ſoon be no more talkt of? One would have thought at firſt, that this wonderful <hi>Monſieur</hi> would have ſpoiled utterly every <hi>Phyſicians practice,</hi> and that they would have had no more to do, he ſo <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> the whole <hi>Art</hi> by his Remedy. And yet we ſee he's return'd long ſince for <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are juſt where they were before his coming.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood, by what I have ſaid, to condemn the uſe of <hi>Natural Acids,</hi> the <hi>Acid Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>ſtomach</hi> ſpeaks their excellency ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Appetite</hi> is immediately aſſiſted by them; and beſides all, <hi>Natural ſalts,</hi> of which <hi>Aliments</hi> are full, are known to be <hi>Acid,</hi> and there is no other <hi>ſalt</hi> in <hi>nature,</hi> but the <hi>Acid,</hi> as is at large proved in the following <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> So that <hi>Acids</hi> have their uſe, and benefit beyond queſtion. But it is the frequent and continual uſe of <hi>Artificial Acids,</hi> ſuch as are drawn by <hi>fire,</hi> and become of a <hi>fiery nature,</hi> that I preſume to tax and queſtion. A <hi>Citron</hi> in a <hi>Feaver</hi> may be of greater help and comfort, and allay the boiling Heat, and reſiſt the prevailing malignity, more than can be thought. The <hi>Juyce</hi> of <hi>Lemmons,</hi> not that <hi>crude Juyce,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vended, and of which the <hi>Syrop</hi> is too too often made, but the <hi>Juyce</hi> of <hi>good Lemmons;</hi> and ſo of <hi>Oranges,</hi> might be put into <hi>Juleps</hi> to give them an <hi>Acidity,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> and no harm done. But a few drops, forſooth, of that <hi>ſuſpected Spirit</hi> are more gentile, and neat, and, for the great honour of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> are grown into common uſe, almoſt as much as <hi>ſalt</hi> for our <hi>meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55119:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Natural Remedies</hi> will prevail, when we have tried as many pretty conceits as we pleaſe. <hi>Nature</hi> will provide us <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> when <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> and <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> as to great part of it, are dead and buried, and have undergone the ſame <hi>Fate</hi> that all <hi>particular Remedies</hi> of <hi>Hectors,</hi> and great <hi>Boaſters</hi> have hitherto done, by the wiſe diſpoſal of <hi>all-ſeeing Providence.</hi> They <hi>dye</hi> commonly with their <hi>Maſters,</hi> or if they do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live their thread of time, they ſoon decline more and more, till they come to loſe all their <hi>Eſteem.</hi>

            <p>Nevertheleſs upon <hi>urgent occaſions,</hi> when <hi>Symptoms</hi> are exceeding <hi>violent,</hi> and are not to be conquer'd with ordinary means, <hi>Acid Spirits</hi> may, and perhaps ought to be uſed. As in a <hi>Pox</hi> or <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> when <hi>Defluxions</hi> are violent, and <hi>Symptoms</hi> accidentally high, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is almoſt in deſpair, and frightned with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Symptoms,</hi> we muſt have recourſe to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> let us ſay what we will, and exhibite that <hi>quantity</hi> which otherwiſe we ſhould not, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been rightly treated at firſt; as we are forced to uſe <hi>Actual Cauteries,</hi> to prevent <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes,</hi> and burn to the purpoſe, when there's a neceſſity for it: So in caſes of the like nature, the <hi>diſguiſed fire</hi> in <hi>Acids</hi> may be given <hi>inwardly,</hi> with ſafety enough. <hi>Peſtilential Feavers,</hi> where the <hi>Bloud</hi> is wholly fluid, and the <hi>Fibres</hi> that gave it conſiſtence, and made it condenſe, when grown cold, are deſtroyed by the <hi>Subtile Malignity,</hi> may perhaps require better or <hi>ſtronger Acids</hi> than <hi>Vinegar</hi> can give.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55119:5"/>
            <p>Having ſpoken thus much in reference to <hi>Acid fiery Spirits,</hi> it may well be enquired, whether or no in the <hi>Diſtillation</hi> of ſuch <hi>Spirits,</hi> there is any <hi>addition</hi> of <hi>weight,</hi> as there is moſt ſenſibly in the inſtances forenamed. To which <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> that <hi>Acid Spirits</hi> come forth with ſuch <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> that it is almoſt <hi>Impoſſible</hi> to lute the <hi>Junctures</hi> ſo exactly well, as not to loſe ſome of them, they are ſo exceeding <hi>fiery,</hi> and of ſo piercing a nature, that ſome of them will break out, do what you can. How will a room ſmell of <hi>Nitrous Spirits,</hi> while they are a <hi>Diſtilling!</hi> they'l try what <hi>Lungs</hi> you are made of, let the <hi>Receiver</hi> be never ſo <hi>big</hi> or <hi>thick.</hi> And this is the reaſon, that the <hi>Ingredients weigh</hi> no more than when they were firſt put in; for as faſt as the <hi>fire</hi> comes in through the <hi>Retort,</hi> ſome <hi>Spirits</hi> break out at the <hi>Junctures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove the nature of theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> to be as <hi>Hot</hi> as I ſay, I could here inſtance an <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this <hi>Author.</hi> 'Twas in ſhort this: he <hi>Diſtilled Vitriol</hi> three dayes and three nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and there came forth an <hi>Acid Spirit,</hi> as it uſes to do; when the veſſels were cold, he found in the <hi>Receiver</hi> nothing but a <hi>Maſs of ſalt,</hi> or <hi>Oyl of Vitriol congealed.</hi> This <hi>ſalt</hi> was ſo exceeding <hi>Cauſtick,</hi> that if he offered to touch the leaſt part of it, it burnt like <hi>fire,</hi> and he was fain immediately to put his hand in water; and when he threw a little of it into the <hi>water,</hi> it made juſt ſuch a hiſſing noiſe as burning coals do; it likewiſe made the <hi>water</hi> very <hi>hot,</hi> hotter than common <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> will do. <hi>See p. 94, 95.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55119:6"/>
            <p>And now I have done with <hi>Acids,</hi> it will be expedient to ſpeak ſomething of <hi>Alkali's. Knife</hi> and <hi>Sheath</hi> go together. <hi>Alkali ſalts,</hi> whether they be made by burning <hi>Plants</hi> into <hi>Aſhes,</hi> or by <hi>Calcination</hi> in a <hi>Retort</hi> or <hi>Crucible,</hi> and ſo making of them a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> &amp;c. they all loſe the nature they were endowed with at firſt, and from <hi>Natural Acid Salts</hi> become <hi>Porous;</hi> the fire by opening them drives out the <hi>Acid</hi> part, and leaves them full of <hi>Pores,</hi> ready to receive, and make an <hi>Ebullition</hi> with any <hi>Acids</hi> they ſhall afterwards meet with; they are partly the <hi>remaining ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrious,</hi> and <hi>fixt</hi> part of what they were, and partly an <hi>additional ſupplement</hi> of <hi>fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are <hi>Natural Alkali's</hi> (though not <hi>Alkali. ſalts</hi>) which perform the good effect of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali's,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Perle, Coral, Crabs-eyes,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe may be uſed to anſwer the <hi>Indication</hi> of <hi>ſweetning Acids,</hi> without any need of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to thoſe productions of fire, to wit, <hi>Alkali ſalts,</hi> unleſs there be extraordinary occaſion; as I ſaid before concerning the uſe of <hi>Natural Acids,</hi> unleſs the greatneſs of <hi>Symptoms</hi> required the <hi>Artificial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Speaking to this purpoſe to a moſt <hi>Ingenious Phyſician,</hi> he was pleaſed to ask me, whether I did not <hi>Roaſt,</hi> and <hi>Boil</hi> the <hi>meat</hi> that I eat, or whether that did terrifie me from <hi>eating</hi> my <hi>meat.</hi> But I think there's a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a warmer ſort of <hi>Infuſion, as Boiling</hi> is, and <hi>heat</hi> at a <hi>diſtance,</hi> which in aleaſure tract of time dries, and prepares <hi>meat</hi> to be fit for the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which inſinuates gently, and which
<pb facs="tcp:55119:6"/>loſes the <hi>deſtructive</hi> quality of <hi>fire,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>diſtance,</hi> as is the manner of <hi>Roaſting;</hi> there's a vaſt difference, I ſay, between theſe <hi>Heats,</hi> and turning <hi>Ingredients</hi> into a <hi>Coal fire,</hi> as is done both in <hi>Retorts</hi> and <hi>Crucibles</hi> in the making of <hi>Artificial acids and alkali's.</hi> And as for <hi>meat,</hi> I cannot much approve; and few <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> I think, do, that which is <hi>Broil'd</hi> on the <hi>Coals,</hi> and ſo nearly partakes of the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> of <hi>fire;</hi> it <hi>digeſts</hi> ill, I am ſure, and breeds <hi>Melancholick</hi> unwholſome nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chymical Digeſtions</hi> are of moſt excellent uſe, to draw out the True and Natural virtue of things; they are made in a <hi>Sand-heat,</hi> or elſe in a <hi>Balne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> mild and tender wayes of <hi>opening</hi> bodies; and the <hi>Remedies</hi> lay no ſuch force upon <hi>Nature,</hi> as upon the <hi>Diſeaſe. Remedies</hi> were at firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by <hi>Nature</hi> ſo well, as to need but little of our help, they were intended to help thoſe poor harmleſs ſouls, who knew no better than to make an ordinary fire to keep themſelves warm by, and theſe could gather a proper <hi>Herb</hi> to heat, or boil in a little water, and there often came rare feats of it too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Volatile Spirits</hi> and <hi>Salts</hi> do riſe with a gentler fire, and may for that <hi>good</hi> reaſon claim prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all <hi>Fixt Alkali's,</hi> whether <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Salts.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon great occaſions they will ſeem to work <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> raiſe <hi>Dead</hi> to <hi>Life,</hi> and when the mild <hi>flame</hi> of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> (in which <hi>Life</hi> is ſaid to conſiſt) ſeems to be quite <hi>extinguiſhed,</hi> theſe <hi>Volatile Spirits</hi> ſhall <hi>light</hi> it again a-freſh, and add new vigour to the languiſhing efforts of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55119:7"/>
            <p>But theſe <hi>Volatiles</hi> too muſt be given with great caution, either the humours muſt be <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> or the <hi>Spirits</hi> very <hi>low,</hi> , or elſe they may <hi>Tranſlate</hi> the humours to the <hi>Brain,</hi> from the parts below, and give the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> a <hi>Nobler Seat</hi> than it had before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniack</hi> is an excellent thing, and though it is derived from <hi>Urinous,</hi> and ſeeming uncleanly <hi>Principles,</hi> yet if well drawn and rectified from Phlegm, has oftentimes great effects, and eſpecially if <hi>Cohobated</hi> upon <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Amber,</hi> will yield to few <hi>Volatiles,</hi> unleſs that moſt <hi>Noble</hi> nay <hi>Royal Preparation</hi> of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard's drops,</hi> Prepared by that <hi>Ingenious</hi> and <hi>Learned Phyſician, Dr. Goodall;</hi> who upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the nature of thoſe <hi>Medicines,</hi> has been ſo free as to acquaint me, that they are ſeparated with that <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>gentle degree</hi> of <hi>fire,</hi> that the <hi>Balneum,</hi> in which the <hi>Glaſs bodies</hi> are placed, are never to exceed the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>humane bloud</hi> circulating in the veſſels, or that of an <hi>Egg,</hi> upon <hi>Incubation:</hi> by which means there is a moſt exact, and even <hi>Natural ſeparation</hi> of the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile</hi> and <hi>Spirituous</hi> parts, from the <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>Phlegmatick.</hi> Whereas if this mild <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>heat</hi> were not obſerv'd, he ſaies the <hi>Principles</hi> would be <hi>confounded</hi> together. After this, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles, with which this <hi>Noble Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is endowed, are by much labour, and proper <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>heat,</hi> both in their repeated <hi>Sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Rectifications,</hi> and <hi>Circulations,</hi> made all with a gentle fire, advanced to that <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> that I have reaſon to eſteem it one of the beſt

               <hi>Nervous, Cephalick,</hi> and <hi>Hyſterick Medicines,</hi> that is uſed in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and much more effectual than others to anſwer all thoſe <hi>Indications</hi> in our <hi>Art,</hi> where <hi>Volatiles,</hi> or <hi>Diaphoreticks</hi> are thought to be uſeful.

            </p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome will ſay, I <hi>Prevaricate</hi> with my Deſign, in <hi>Prefacing</hi> ſuch <hi>Cautions</hi> to a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and making great part of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> a little too much ſuſpected; and eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what I ſaid in <hi>praiſe</hi> of this <hi>Art</hi> before the <hi>COURSE OF CHYMISTRY.</hi> But I would have it conſider'd, that I never thought this ſort of <hi>Remedies</hi> of much uſe in <hi>Feavers,</hi> and that <hi>Chronical diſtempers</hi> might poſſibly find ſome greater relief from thoſe <hi>Active Medicines,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the tryal of others, by virtue of that Maxime, <hi>à mitioribus ad fortiora progredien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> Theſe things may require ſome longer Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and perhaps I may urge them further here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when I may ſpeak more at large concerning <hi>Remedies,</hi> and give ſome <hi>Practical Obſervations</hi> upon them.

            <head>AN APPENDIX TO A COURSE of CHYMISTRY, CONTAINING The eaſieſt manner of performing thoſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that are in uſe in Phyſick.</head>
            <div type="addition">
               <p>ADD to Page 6. Line 26. In the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> upon the <hi>Principles of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</hi> Nothing but the <hi>Oyl,</hi> can proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to be <hi>Inflammable,</hi> and the <hi>Oyl</hi> is ſo much the more ſo, as the Salts, with which it is cloſely united, have been more or leſs ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualized. For that which I call <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Oyl,</hi> is nothing but an <hi>Eſſential</hi> or <hi>Volatile Salt;</hi> this <hi>Salt</hi> is not of it ſelf <hi>Inflammable,</hi> but ſerves to Rarifie and Exalt the parts of the <hi>Oyl</hi> to render them the more ſuſceptible of Motion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of <hi>Flagration;</hi> after the ſame manner as when <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is put to mix with ſome Oyly ſubſtance, this Oyly matter fires much more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than when it is alone; though <hi>Salt-peter</hi> of it ſelf is not at all <hi>Inflammable,</hi> as I ſhall prove hereafter. We have Examples of the truth of what I ſay in <hi>Spirit of Wine, Oyl of Turpentine,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55119:10"/>and all other Inflammable Liquors; for they are only <hi>Oyls</hi> ſubtilized and refined by the Volatile Salts they contain. Sticks, and other parts of Vegetables have a great deal of Salt much like to Salt-peter; this Salt being ſtraitly united with their Oyl makes them the more apt to flame, than if it had not been a part. The Fat of Animals is full of a Volatile Acid falt; Wax, Roſine, and all other matters that are inflammable, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with an <hi>Acid Salt, Eſſential</hi> or <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay the <hi>Salt</hi> which cauſes the <hi>flagration</hi> of <hi>Oyls,</hi> muſt be either <hi>Volatile</hi> or <hi>Eſſential,</hi> for if it were a <hi>fixt Salt,</hi> 'twould have a contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it would allay in ſome meaſure the quick motion of the parts of an Inflammable body; and this we ſee happens when <hi>Sea-ſalt</hi> is flung in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, it ſerves to put it out. <hi>Common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> yields us another inſtance of the ſame kind: conſiſting of one part Sulphurous or Oyly, and another Saline or fixt Acid, which plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the opening of it, the Oyly part fires, and would ſoon riſe like other Oyls into a great White Flame, but that the Acid part being a load to its activity hinders it from riſing, and ſo forces it to caſt but only a ſmall Blew Flame; and a proof of what I affirm may be had from mixing <hi>Salt-peter</hi> with <hi>Sulphur;</hi> for the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of <hi>Salt peter</hi> does <hi>Volatilize</hi> the <hi>Salts</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and cauſes a White flame to burn violently, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Salt Polychreſt.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Add to <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. <hi>Lin.</hi> 22. Is it not likely enough that the bottom of the <hi>Sea,</hi> or its ſhores, may be much like the ſurface of the Earth we inhabit, and that there may be Mountains, Rocks, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſorts of earth, and conſequently <hi>inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mountains of Salt</hi> in a Million of places at the bottom of the Sea, whence it receives its Brackiſhneſs?</p>
               <p>And it may be there are Waters, which after taking Salt from ſeveral earths, do at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves into the ſea through an infinite number of ſubterranean channels, which do much contribute likewiſe to making Sea-water ſalt.</p>
               <p>That which confirms me in this opinion is, becauſe there are <hi>Lakes</hi> in <hi>Italy, Germany, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> and many other places, which are as <hi>Salt</hi> as the <hi>Sea,</hi> and can have no other cauſe but that their <hi>waters</hi> have hapned to run through <hi>Mines of Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not but many will be apt to object againſt my Opinion, that the <hi>Sea</hi> being of ſo prodigious boundleſs an extent, all the <hi>Salt</hi> I have ſpoken of, would not be able to ſalt it as it is; but if they pleaſe to conſider, that this great extent of the Ocean may meet with <hi>Mines of Salt</hi> in abundance of places, and what is once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved can never be ſeparated from it, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded their doubt will ſoon vaniſh. Add to what is ſaid, that <hi>Sea-water</hi> does not contain ſo great a quantity of Salt as is commonly imagined: and this is eaſily prov'd, if you take the pains to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55119:11"/>evaporate ſome of it over the fire, or diſſolve ſalt in that water; for it will receive a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity into it, which is a certain ſign, that the water was not ſo ſalt before, as it might have been, for if it had been impregnated with as much as it could, 'twould have diſſolved no more.</p>
               <p>Therefore we have good reaſon to believe, that the <hi>Sea,</hi> which may be called a large <hi>Lake,</hi> becomes <hi>Salt</hi> through the <hi>Mines</hi> that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the <hi>Salt Currents</hi> that in ſeveral places empty into it.</p>

               <p>Add to <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. <hi>Lin.</hi> 30. It may be objected that <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is found in places where no <hi>Acid</hi> liquor can be thought to come; but no body can doubt but that there is an <hi>Acid</hi> in the <hi>Air;</hi> which though a very inſenſible body, is able enough to enter into <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Earths,</hi> the truth whereof is ſeen every day in <hi>Earths</hi> that have loſt their <hi>Salt</hi> as much as could be drawn by Art, which upon being expoſed ſome time to the open air get new additions of <hi>Salt,</hi> and encreaſe their weight conſiderably. Now the liquor that I ſpeak of, which runs in ſome places of the earth, receives its <hi>Acidity</hi> from this <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> which condenſes in ſome places better than in others, by reaſon of the coolneſs, or ſome other diſpoſition it finds there.</p>
               <p>I conceive therefore that <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is form'd in <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Earths</hi> by the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> after the ſame manner as <hi>Sal Gemme</hi> in <hi>Mines</hi> by an <hi>Acid</hi> liquour, and that this <hi>Aerial
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55119:11"/>Acid</hi> entring inſenſibly into the body of <hi>Stones</hi> produces a Salt at firſt much like <hi>Sal Gemme;</hi> but afterwards new <hi>Acid Spirits</hi> ſtill coming and mixing with it makes it of a middle nature between <hi>Volatile</hi> and <hi>Fixt.</hi> And it is for this reaſon that a great deal of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is taken from old ruined buildings, for the <hi>Stones</hi> there continuing a long time expoſed to the <hi>Air,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive greater quantity of <hi>Spirits</hi> than other ſtones; it is likewiſe to be found in Cellers and other places where the Sun caſts no heat, becauſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> does there eaſily condenſe by reaſon of the coolneſs and moiſture.</p>

All <hi>Earths</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with an <hi>Acid Salt,</hi> as I have ſaid, 'tis not hard to conceive how that the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> is communicated to them from the <hi>earth</hi> wherein they grew. Their <hi>Growth</hi> muſt needs have proceeded from a <hi>Salt juice</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> they grew in, which having opened the <hi>Seed</hi> through the Fermentation it cauſed, infinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates and filters it ſelf into the Fibers that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the <hi>Plant;</hi> and the leaving grounds Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſome years, is in order to preſerve and retain the <hi>Salt</hi> that is continually encreaſed in them by the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Air.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Dung,</hi> and other matters, which are ſaid to fatten and fructifie Lands, do ſo by nothing elſe but their <hi>Salt.</hi> Neither need we wonder at the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sandy and ſtony ſoils, for that the <hi>Acid</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> cannot unite and fix with them in ſufficient quantity to render them fertile. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55119:12"/>'tis worth obſervation, that there are Lands which remain barren too through too great an abundance of <hi>Salt</hi> they contain, and for this reaſon in <hi>Egypt</hi> they are forced to temper their grounds with <hi>Sand</hi> after the Ebbing of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> to make them Fertile; becauſe the <hi>Earth,</hi> 'till that is done, is ſo full of <hi>Salt,</hi> that its pores are quite choaked up with it. So that inſtead of cauſing any <hi>Fermentation</hi> in the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Salt</hi> fixes and depreſſes it, that it can't have its motion free enough to rarifie, and raiſe a ſtalk; but now when <hi>Sand</hi> is mingled with it, it is able to divide and extend the <hi>Salt,</hi> which not having then ſuch power of <hi>fixing</hi> the <hi>Seed,</hi> it Ferments and riſes into a <hi>Plant.</hi> Whence it may be ſeen, that <hi>too much Salt</hi> is as Offenſive to the Earths fertility, as <hi>too little,</hi> and that it is the ſame thing with other Fermentable matters as it is with Earths, they come to ferment by means of a <hi>moderate quantity</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> mixed with them, for if you add too much, the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be ſpoil'd.</p>
               <p>Again, every kind of <hi>Salt</hi> is not fit to <hi>ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi> lands, it muſt be a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> or <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching</hi> to the nature of <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> to ſerve for Vegetation; a <hi>Salt</hi> too <hi>fixt</hi> would rather ſpoil it, and it has been obſerv'd that places which ſhould fructifie, have brought forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when <hi>Sea-ſalt</hi> has been ſprinkled upon them; the reaſon of which is for that this <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> hinders the Fermentation that was neceſſary to produce fertility.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55119:12"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſs it ſometimes happens, that the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> though full of a <hi>fixt ſalt,</hi> do ſerve to <hi>fertilize;</hi> and this Countrey men are well acquainted with, who in ſome places where they find their Lands too lean and barren to yield any thing without aſſiſtance of Art, do uſe at certain ſeaſons of the year to burn <hi>Fern</hi> and <hi>Turfs</hi> upon them, and <hi>ſpread</hi> about the <hi>Aſhes.</hi> Now it is by reaſon of a <hi>Lixivious ſalt</hi> in the <hi>Aſhes,</hi> that the <hi>Lands</hi> are hereby <hi>improv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this happens for the ſame reaſon as I ſaid before, for the <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> that lies in the <hi>Aſhes</hi> is very <hi>Porous,</hi> as I ſhall prove hereafter; and ſo does very well mix with the <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Acid Salts</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and turns eaſily into <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> as when the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> mixt with an <hi>Alkali ſalt,</hi> makes a <hi>good Salt-peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>ſea-ſalt,</hi> poſſibly it might happen, that if it were left in the Earth for ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, 'twould impregnate with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and ſo being at length <hi>Volatilized</hi> would render a place fertile. But becauſe it is a very compact body, and its parts cloſely united, the Volatilizing of it would be a tedious buſineſs, and ſo the preſent requiſite Fermentation fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the place would remain barren too long to gratifie our expectations.</p>
               <p>'Tis very likely that the <hi>Volatile</hi> or <hi>Nitrous ſalt</hi> meets in the Earth with ſome <hi>Sulphurous</hi> or fat matter, that is continually raiſed by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean heat toward the Surface of the Earth, and unites with it. This <hi>mixture</hi> of a <hi>Volatile
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55119:13"/>ſalt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> together may much contribute towards explicating the manner of <hi>Vegetation;</hi> for juſt as the mixture of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt-peter</hi> does excellently diſpoſe to an <hi>Exaltation</hi> by heat, which will not happen while they are ſeparated; ſo the Bituminous or fat part of the earth mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Salt-peter, which all Earths have, the ſubterranean heat exalts them much more eaſily, than if the Salt were alone. And now let us ſee what happens from this <hi>Exaltation</hi> to the production of Plants.</p>
               <p>Some part of this <hi>Sulphurous ſalt,</hi> meeting with <hi>ſeed</hi> in the earth proper to grow, does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>ſeed,</hi> and cauſe a Fermentation, that is to ſay, <hi>ſuppling</hi> the parts of the <hi>ſeed,</hi> diſpoſes it to open it ſelf. Now 'tis very certain, and what has been ſenſibly demonſtrated by <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes,</hi> that each <hi>grain</hi> of <hi>ſeed</hi> contains in little the <hi>whole Plant</hi> with all its parts. Wherefore this opening the body of the <hi>ſeed</hi> is by reaſon that the <hi>ſulphurous ſalts</hi> entring at the pores of the <hi>Root</hi> of this <hi>ſmall Plant,</hi> and by their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile quality inſinuating all along the Fibres which conſtitute the <hi>Plant,</hi> do orderly diſplay before us what was before but very confuſed in reſpect of us.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>ſalts</hi> do never enter at the head of the Plant, and ſo deſcend to the Root, though often the Root of the Seed lies uppermoſt, and the head or ſtalk downwards, becauſe the Pores of the ſtalk are not of ſuch a Figure as is proper to receive them, whereas thoſe of the Root have a proper contexture.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55119:13"/>
               <p>The <hi>Volatility</hi> of theſe <hi>Salts</hi> does alſo cauſe the ſtalk, though ſeated downwards, to riſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and follow their tendency, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways up; and this is that which by extending and enlarging the Fibres of the Plant, makes it grow to that height which their nature requires.</p>
               <p>'Tis probable that this fat part of earth inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating with the <hi>ſalt,</hi> as I have ſaid, does make the <hi>Oyl</hi> of a mixt body; for we find that thoſe matters which help beſt to fertilize, are full of <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> as <hi>Dung, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and <hi>Plants corrupted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis fit to obſerve here, that the <hi>ſalt</hi> does act after another-guiſe manner than the <hi>Oyl</hi> in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Fermentation or corruption of the matter 'tis mixed with; for it does not only ſtop the pores, and hinder the air from entring, but fixes it likewiſe by its hooked parts, that it can neither have motion nor rarefaction, for which reaſon 'tis that <hi>Meat</hi> is <hi>ſalted</hi> in order to keep it <hi>ſweet,</hi> and does thereby remain firm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact for ſome time.</p>
               <p>Three kinds of <hi>ſalt</hi> are drawn from <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> an <hi>Acid ſalt</hi> called <hi>Eſſential,</hi> a <hi>Volatile,</hi> and a <hi>Fixt ſalt.</hi> The firſt is like <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like <hi>Tartar,</hi> according as it contains more or leſs earth; this <hi>ſalt</hi> is drawn from the <hi>juice</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi> as I ſaid before; for after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and purifying this <hi>juice,</hi> 'tis ſet in a veſſel in ſome cool place a few daies without ſtirring, and the <hi>ſalt</hi> ſhoots into <hi>Cryſtals</hi> all about. This <hi>Acid ſalt</hi> may be ſaid to be the <hi>true ſalt</hi> that was in the <hi>Plant,</hi> becauſe the means
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55119:14"/>that are uſed in drawing it are <hi>Natural,</hi> and ſuch as cannot change its nature; but this can't be ſaid of thoſe others, becauſe the violent fires that are uſed about them make impreſſions of another nature, and their effects are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſo that the fire ſeems to alter and diſguiſe them, as I ſhall ſhew in the following diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>ſalt,</hi> or the <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> is uſually drawn from <hi>ſeeds</hi> or <hi>fruits</hi> Fermenting. While it remains in the <hi>Vegetable,</hi> it differs from the <hi>Eſſential ſalt</hi> only in this, that being driven up higher by <hi>Spirits,</hi> it becomes more <hi>Volatile.</hi> The <hi>Fermentation</hi> that is cauſed in fruits by beating and bruiſing them, does very much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in <hi>Volatilizing</hi> the <hi>ſalt;</hi> for it ſets the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at work, and diſpoſes them for an eaſier ſeparation; but it happens that in the great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, or continual motion this <hi>ſalt</hi> is in, it unites ſo ſtrongly with the <hi>Oyl</hi> that Fruits and Seeds are full of, that they can't be ſeparated by <hi>Cryſtallizing</hi> the <hi>juice,</hi> as they can in drawing them from other parts of the <hi>Plant.</hi> We muſt therefore have recourſe to the help of fire. The <hi>Fruit</hi> or <hi>ſeed</hi> which contains the <hi>Volatile ſalt,</hi> as I ſhall prove in its proper place, is Diſtilled by a <hi>Retort,</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> comes forth in the firſt place, then an <hi>Oyl,</hi> and laſtly a moſt keen ill ſcented <hi>Salt</hi> (that eaſily flies away) upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the fire to purpoſe, is driven into the <hi>Receiver.</hi> Now 'tis plain that fire has changed, or elſe added ſome thing to this <hi>ſalt;</hi> for when 'twas in the <hi>Plant,</hi> it had no manner of <hi>ſmell</hi> like that it gets by <hi>diſtillation.</hi> But to ſhew there's
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55119:14"/>a ſtrange <hi>Alteration</hi> in this <hi>ſalt,</hi> as ſoon as 'tis mixed with an <hi>Acid,</hi> there preſently appears an <hi>Ebullition,</hi> or <hi>Efferveſcency,</hi> which remains until the <hi>Acid</hi> has throughly entred into the <hi>ſalt.</hi> Which circumſtance does not happen to it in its <hi>Natural</hi> being, 'tis this <hi>Ebullition</hi> that gave it the name of a <hi>Volatile Alkali,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from a <hi>Fixt Alkali,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The <hi>Chymiſts</hi> will needs have this <hi>Volatile Alkali</hi> to be in the <hi>Plant,</hi> juſt the ſame as when it is drawn; that is to ſay, they make this a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>ſalt,</hi> lying hid under the <hi>Acid,</hi> until it is laid open by the force of fire. But this opinion is founded on no credible experience, for <hi>Anatomize</hi> the <hi>Plant</hi> how you think fit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing fire, and you ſhall never find any other but an <hi>Acid ſalt.</hi> Doubtleſs 'twill be ſaid, that all other ways of diffecting <hi>Plants</hi> even into their <hi>ſalts,</hi> prove too weak without the aſſiſtance of this <hi>grand diſſolvent</hi> fire. But if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der impartially how fire acts, we ſhall be forc'd to acknowledge that it rather deſtroyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the greateſt part of the bodies it opens, and does not leave them in the <hi>natural</hi> ſtate they were in before, and eſpecially when 'tis driven with that force which is neceſſary to draw this <hi>ſalt.</hi> So that I ſee no reaſon why the <hi>Species</hi> of things ſhould be <hi>multiplied</hi> without neceſſity, by admitting many kinds of <hi>ſalts</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> and I conceive with much more probability, that the <hi>Volatile Alkali ſalt</hi> is a part of the <hi>Acid Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſalt</hi> I ſpoke of, which having been firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a <hi>Volatile</hi> nature, and afterwards driven
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55119:15"/>by the force of fire, draws along with it a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Empyreumatical Oyl,</hi> that gives it ſuch a <hi>diſagreeable ſmell,</hi> and ſome terreſtrious cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined matter, with which it is ſo ſtrongly united, and which changes its nature, by breaking the <hi>Saline</hi> points, and rendring them <hi>Porous,</hi> ſo that any <hi>Acid</hi> liquor being caſt upon it, enters into the <hi>Pores</hi> and violently divides the parts, whence follows the <hi>Efferveſcency.</hi> Perchance likewiſe this <hi>Calx</hi> or Calcined earth may have retained igneous particles, and ſo the edges of the <hi>Acid</hi> beginning to open the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> theſe little igneous bodies being in a violent motion do ſtrike about, and break open all their ſmall priſons, and from thence it may be, the violent <hi>Ebullition</hi> happens. Such as are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced with the Sentiments of ancient <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> will relliſh very hardly this new Opinion of mine; but I am perſwaded if any one will take the pains to examine the matter near at hand, and make ſome <hi>Experiments</hi> on the <hi>ſalts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> he ſhall find my Diſcourſe come near enough to truth.</p>
               <p>The laſt <hi>ſalt</hi> or the <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> remains united with the earthy part after <hi>Diſtillation</hi> of the other ſubſtances; the matter is taken out of the <hi>Retort,</hi> and <hi>calcined</hi> in an open fire, for to free it from the <hi>ſoot</hi> that blackens it; afterwards the <hi>ſalt</hi> is drawn by a <hi>Lixivium</hi> as I have ſhewn before. This <hi>ſalt</hi> is called <hi>fixt,</hi> in compariſon with others, becauſe this can't <hi>ſublime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Chymiſts</hi> do aſſure us, but with little foundation for it, that in Terreſtrial bodies, in <hi>Metalls, Corals, Pearls,</hi> and generally in all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55119:15"/>bodies that Ferment with <hi>Acids,</hi> there is an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Alkali</hi> in them, which is one of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> wherefore they give them the name of <hi>Alkali's;</hi> but becauſe no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Salt</hi> can be drawn from them, to prove their Opinion, and they have no other rational Argument to perſwade me, they muſt give me leave to think otherwiſe than they have done, and I conceive that the contrary to what they have eſtabliſhed will ſerve me better to explicate the truth.</p>
               <p>Following therefore the <hi>Principle</hi> I have laid, I believe that thoſe Terreſtrial bodies are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Alkali's,</hi> rather than that the <hi>Ebullition</hi> of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali</hi> proceeds from a <hi>ſalt</hi> ſuppoſed to be contained in them; and further that the <hi>ſalts</hi> are never <hi>Alkali's</hi> 'till they have undergone the force of fire, and been reduced into a <hi>Calx.</hi> I have proved, ſpeaking of the nature of <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalt,</hi> that the fire did very much change the ſubſtances of things; and as I have ſhewn there is good reaſon to think there is but only one <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>ſalt</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> and the <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> is but a change wrought by fire, I ſhall proceed upon the ſame <hi>Principle,</hi> and affirm that there is no <hi>fixt Alkali ſalt</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> but that by <hi>Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the fire has fixt a part of the <hi>Acid Eſſential ſalt</hi> with the earthy part that has ſerv'd to break the keeneſt of its points, and rendred them <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> like a <hi>Calx.</hi> 'Tis by reaſon of theſe <hi>Pores</hi> that this kind of <hi>ſalt</hi> grows humid and melts ſo eaſily when expoſed to the Air; and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrious parts do turn it into an <hi>Alkali,</hi> for if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55119:16"/>they were not mixed with it, 'twould continue ſtill an <hi>Acid ſalt,</hi> and oppoſed to <hi>Alkali.</hi> But to clear up this point the better, we muſt conſider as nicely as may be the nature of an <hi>Acid</hi> and an <hi>Alkali.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whenas the nature of a thing ſo obſcure as that of <hi>ſalt,</hi> can't better be explicated, than by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to its parts ſuch figures as are anſwerable to the effects it produces; I ſhall affirm, that the <hi>Acidity</hi> of any liquor does conſiſt in keen particles of <hi>ſalts,</hi> in motion; and I hope no body will offer to diſpute whether an <hi>Acid</hi> has points or no, ſeeing every ones experience does demonſtrate it, they need but <hi>taſte</hi> an <hi>Acid</hi> to be ſatisfied of it, for it pricks the tongue like any thing keen and finely cut; but a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and convincing proof that an <hi>Acid</hi> does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of pointed parts is, that not only all <hi>Acid ſalts</hi> do <hi>Cryſtallize</hi> into edges, but all Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of different things, cauſed by <hi>acid</hi> liquors, do aſſume this figure in their <hi>Cryſtallization;</hi> theſe <hi>Cryſtalls</hi> conſiſt of points differing both in length and bigneſs one from another, and this diverſity muſt be attributed to the keener or blunter edges of the different ſorts of <hi>Acids;</hi> and ſo likewiſe this difference of the points in ſubtilty is the cauſe that one <hi>acid</hi> can penetrate and diſſolve well one ſort of <hi>mixt,</hi> that another can't rarifie at all: thus <hi>Vinegar</hi> diſſolves <hi>Lead,</hi> which <hi>aqua fortis</hi> can't: <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> diſſolves <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> which <hi>Vinegar</hi> will not touch; <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> diſſolves <hi>Gold,</hi> whenas <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> can't meddle with it; on the contrary <hi>Aqua
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55119:16"/>fortis</hi> diſſolves <hi>Silver,</hi> but can do nothing with <hi>Gold,</hi> and ſo the reſt.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Alkali's,</hi> they are ſoon known by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Acid</hi> upon them, for preſently, or ſoon after, there riſes a violent <hi>Ebullition,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains until the <hi>Acid</hi> finds no more bodies to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie. This effect may make us reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that an <hi>Alkali</hi> is a terreſtrial and ſolid matter, whoſe <hi>pores</hi> are figured after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the <hi>Acid</hi> points entring into them do ſtrike at and divide whatſoever oppoſes their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and according as the parts of which the <hi>Alkali</hi> is compounded, are more or leſs ſolid, the <hi>Acids</hi> finding more or leſs reſiſtance, do cauſe a ſtronger or weaker <hi>Ebullition.</hi> So we ſee the <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> that happens in the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Coral</hi> is very much milder than that in the diſſolution of <hi>Silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are as many different <hi>Alkali's,</hi> as there are bodies that have different pores, and this is the reaſon why an <hi>Acid</hi> will Ferment one ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and another not at all; for there muſt be a due proportion between the <hi>Acid</hi> points, and the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Alkali.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nature of <hi>Alkali's</hi> being thus eſtabliſhed, there will be no need of flying to an imaginary <hi>ſalt</hi> in <hi>Plants</hi> for explication of the <hi>Efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and 'twill be eaſily conceived that if an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali ſalt</hi> is full of a terreſtrial matter that renders it <hi>porous</hi> like other <hi>Alkali's,</hi> it muſt cauſe an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition.</hi> That which I ſaid, ſpeaking of <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalts,</hi> may here be added, that the Igneous particles breaking out through the Pores of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55119:17"/>
                  <hi>Alkali ſalt,</hi> where they became impriſoned in the <hi>Calcination,</hi> do much contribute to the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Efferveſcency.</hi> And really when the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Aquafortis</hi> is caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>Alkali ſalt,</hi> there happens as ſtrong an <hi>Ebullition,</hi> as when this liquor is flung into the fire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fermentation</hi> that happens to <hi>Dow,</hi> to <hi>New Wine,</hi> and ſuch like things differs from that I now ſpoke of, in that it is more gentle, and ſlow; this is cauſed by the <hi>Acid Natural ſalt</hi> contained in them, which expanding and exalting it ſelf by its motion, does rarifie and raiſe up the groſſer and ſulphurous part that endeavours to allay its motion, from whence it comes that the matter ſwells up.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why an <hi>Acid</hi> does not make <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous</hi> things Ferment, with ſo much noiſe and ſuddenneſs as <hi>Alkali's,</hi> is, becauſe that <hi>Oyls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of pliant parts that yield and make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the points of <hi>Acids,</hi> as a piece of <hi>Wool</hi> or <hi>Cotton</hi> will yield and give way to needles that are thruſt into it. Thus methinks two ſorts of <hi>Fermentations</hi> may be admitted of, the one of an <hi>Acid</hi> with an <hi>Alkali,</hi> which may be called <hi>Ebullition,</hi> and the other, when an <hi>Acid</hi> does by little and little rarifie ſome ſoftiſh matter, as <hi>Dow,</hi> or clear and Sulphurous, as <hi>Muſte, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and all other juices of Plants. This laſt ſort may rather be called <hi>Fermentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis further remarkable that the <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali</hi> do ſo deſtroy one another in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, that when as much <hi>Acid</hi> has been by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55119:17"/>poured as is neceſſary to penetrate the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali</hi> in all its parts, it is then no more an <hi>Alkali,</hi> nor can it be ſo again, though you waſh it to carry off the <hi>Acid,</hi> becauſe it has no longer <hi>that diſpoſition</hi> of <hi>Pores</hi> which is requiſite in an <hi>alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li;</hi> and the <hi>Acid</hi> breaks and loſes its points in the conteſt eſpecially when the <hi>alkali</hi> is pretty compact and ſolid; ſo that if you would reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your <hi>Acid</hi> again, you'l find it has in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner loſt all its <hi>acidity,</hi> and retains only a ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Oyl</hi> conſiſting of ſupple yielding parts does only receive ſome <hi>Acid</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and no ſuch cloſe union, ſo that it can be drawn from Sulphureous bodies much the ſame as when it was mixt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> does differ but little from the <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> of <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> both which are drawn in a <hi>Retort;</hi> they have the ſame kind of ſmell, taſte, and other virtues. The <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> of <hi>animals</hi> keeps dry a longer time than the others, becauſe it carries away with it more <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> than thoſe others. As for <hi>fixt ſalt, animals</hi> do yield but a very little of it, and in ſome <hi>animals</hi> you ſhall find none at all; it is drawn as the <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> of <hi>Plants;</hi> they are both <hi>alkali's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no <hi>ſalt</hi> that can be called <hi>alkali,</hi> to be found in the parts, or humors of <hi>animals,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they have paſſed the fire; a Saline ſeroſity may be obſerved in them, but that <hi>ſalt</hi> is <hi>acid;</hi> and it proceeds doubtleſs from the Aliments that are taken for nouriſhment. Now as I have ſhewn that there is only an <hi>acid ſalt</hi> in <hi>Earths</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55119:18"/>and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> ſo I may ſay the ſame of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> and the rather becauſe no other kind of <hi>ſalt</hi> can be found in them in their <hi>Natural</hi> ſtate; the <hi>alkali ſalts</hi> that are drawn from them, are only ſeveral mutations of an <hi>Acid ſalt,</hi> made by fire, which mingles with them earthy particles after the manner I have ſpoken of treating of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali's</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> But it is obſervable, that whereas there is a greater proportion of <hi>Spirits</hi> in <hi>Animals</hi> than <hi>Seeds,</hi> theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> do ſerve to <hi>exalt</hi> all the <hi>Salt;</hi> which is the reaſon that leſs <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> is to be found in <hi>Animals</hi> than <hi>Plants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for what many do ſay that <hi>Choler</hi> cauſes an <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> like an <hi>alkali,</hi> when an <hi>acid</hi> is caſt upon it, 'tis a miſtake through want of right Obſervation, for no <hi>Ebullition</hi> at all happens for ſome time. Nevertheleſs I will not ſay, that an <hi>Acid</hi> produces no <hi>Fermentation</hi> in <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Bloud,</hi> and other parts of the body, for it does very often really do that; but that is no more than uſes to be done in <hi>New Wine, Beer,</hi> and other liquors of the like nature. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready explicated this ſort of <hi>Fermentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhould not omit ſpeaking of the <hi>Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that's made in <hi>Milk</hi> after a <hi>Fermentation</hi> cauſed either by <hi>Heat,</hi> or ſome <hi>Acid</hi> put into it.</p>
               <p>Methinks here is no need at all of ſuppoſing an <hi>Alkali ſalt,</hi> that ferments with the <hi>Acid</hi> of this liquor, as many ſuppoſe for explicating this Effect, ſince if we conſider but the natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Milk,</hi> we ſhall find nothing but a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55119:18"/>Creamy ſubſtance ſwimming on the <hi>Serum,</hi> and mixed only ſuperficially with it, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of ſome <hi>ſalt;</hi> ſo that it is in a fitting ſtate of ſeparation, as ſoon as the <hi>ſalt</hi> gains a little more motion than it had, whether it be by <hi>Fermentation,</hi> or by encreaſing its activity by an <hi>acid</hi> of its own nature. Thus when the <hi>Heat</hi> of the Summer, or fire has ſtirred up the <hi>acid</hi> that is in the <hi>Milk,</hi> or elſe ſome <hi>acid</hi> is poured into it, the edges of the <hi>acid</hi> do cut and divide the Creamy part, to gain a free motion in the <hi>Serum,</hi> and ſeparate into <hi>Curd</hi> all the Butter and Cheeſe. Now there's no ſtrangeneſs in the <hi>Precipitation</hi> of the <hi>Curd,</hi> eſpecially when an <hi>acid</hi> has been poured upon the <hi>Milk,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the weight it gains by thickning, ſome part of the <hi>acids</hi> do mix with it, and encreaſe its weight; for according as the <hi>acid</hi> that was mingled is ſtronger or weaker, the <hi>Curd</hi> does <hi>Precipitate</hi> more or leſs.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſome will ſay, for as much as <hi>acid</hi> is always the cauſe of <hi>Coagulation</hi> in <hi>Milk,</hi> there's no great likelihood that a <hi>ſalt</hi> of the ſame nature ſhould be the inſtrument of uniting the ſeveral parts of <hi>Milk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it muſt be conſidered, that although there is an <hi>acid</hi> in <hi>Milk</hi> (as no body can doubt, ſeeing it ſowres of it ſelf, when ſtale) this <hi>acid</hi> is as it were tyed up in the ramous parts of the <hi>Oyl,</hi> ſo that there it loſes all its motion and can't come to action but by rarifying the <hi>Oyl,</hi> and making it fit to mix with the <hi>ſerous</hi> part; 'tis the due proportion of this <hi>ſalt, Oyl,</hi> and <hi>ſerum,</hi> that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55119:19"/>makes the <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheeſy</hi> part of <hi>Milk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I hope I have ſaid enough to eſtabliſh what I have affirmed, that there's no <hi>ſalt</hi> in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beſides the <hi>acid,</hi> out of which all other <hi>ſalts</hi> are made, and that the <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> has no <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural exiſtence</hi> in mixt bodies. My diſcourſe will be the better conceiv'd of, ſpeaking of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Chymiſtry, and you'l find that by this <hi>Principle,</hi> which I may call the moſt <hi>Natural</hi> and diſengaged of all that have been laid 'till now, I ſhall be able to give account of many <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena's</hi> that have never been explicated by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Principles.</hi>

               <p>Whatſoever is found <hi>Petrified</hi> in the Earth, or on its ſurface, is called <hi>Mineral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petrification</hi> is made by a <hi>Coagulation</hi> of <hi>acid</hi> or <hi>ſalt ſpirits,</hi> that are found in the pores of the Earth.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Petrification</hi> differs according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſpoſitions, or different nature of the Earth, and according to the time that Nature uſes in its perfection.</p>
               <p>The growth of <hi>Minerals</hi> proceeds from an accumulation, or from ſeveral veins of congeled Waters, that do as it were glue together, and theſe veins are the cauſe that all the adjacent parts have their <hi>Sinus,</hi> and meetings a travers one another, and not running directly downwards.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Sinus,</hi> like ſo many joints, are of great help to Labourers to cut in the Quarries; for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55119:19"/>by thoſe cavities the ſtones are in great meaſure ſeparated before-hand, whereas 'twould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hard working them out, if nature had not ſo concurred.</p>
               <p>The growth of <hi>Minerals</hi> is very different from that of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and <hi>Animals;</hi> for whereas the former does happen through an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination of congeled waters, as I have ſaid; the latter is performed by means of <hi>juyces</hi> that inſinuate and ſpread in the veſſels and fibres, that <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Plants</hi> do conſiſt of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metals</hi> do differ from <hi>Minerals</hi> in being <hi>malleable,</hi> which the others are not.</p>
               <p>They are counted ſeven, <hi>Gold, Sylver, Iron, Tinn, Copper, Lead,</hi> and <hi>Quicksylver,</hi> this laſt is not <hi>malleable</hi> of it ſelf, but is ſo mingled with the others; but becauſe this is thought to be the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> 'tis numbred with the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> have conceited that there was ſo great an affinity and correſpondence between the Seven <hi>Metals</hi> before named, and the ſeven <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> that nothing happened to the one, but the other ſhared in it; they made this correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to happen through an infinite number of little bodies that paſt to and from each of them; and they ſuppoſe theſe corpuſcles to be ſo figured that they can eaſily paſs through the pores of the <hi>Planet</hi> and <hi>Metal</hi> they repreſent, but cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into other bodies becauſe their pores are not figured properly to receive them; or elſe if they do chance to get admittance into other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they can't fix and ſtay there to contribute
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55119:20"/>any nouriſhment; for they do imagine that the <hi>Metal</hi> is <hi>nouriſhed</hi> and perfected by the <hi>Influence</hi> that comes from its <hi>Planet,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Planet</hi> again the ſame from the <hi>Metal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons they have given theſe ſeven <hi>Metals</hi> the name of the ſeven <hi>Planets,</hi> each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as they are governed: and ſo have called <hi>Gold</hi> the <hi>Sun, Sylver</hi> the <hi>Moon, Iron Mars, Quicksylver Mercury, Tinn Jupiter, Copper Venus,</hi> and <hi>Lead Saturn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have likewiſe fancied that each of theſe <hi>Planets</hi> has his day apart to diſtribute liberally his <hi>Influence</hi> on our Hemiſphere; and ſo they tell us that if we work upon <hi>Sylver</hi> on <hi>Munday, Iron</hi> on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and ſo of the reſt, we ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our end much better than on other daies.</p>
               <p>Again they have taught us that the ſeven <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> do every one govern ſome particular prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of our bodies; and becauſe the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> do repreſent the <hi>Planets,</hi> they muſt needs be mighty <hi>ſpecifick</hi> in curing the diſtempers of thoſe parts, and keeping them in good plight. Thus they have aſſigned the <hi>Heart</hi> to <hi>Gold,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> to <hi>Sylver,</hi> the <hi>Liver</hi> to <hi>Iron,</hi> the <hi>Lungs</hi> to <hi>Tinn,</hi> the <hi>Reins</hi> to <hi>Copper,</hi> and the <hi>Spleen</hi> to <hi>Lead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee in ſhort what ſome of the <hi>ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aſtrologers</hi> do fancy concerning <hi>Metals,</hi> and they draw conſequences from hence, which 'twould be too long here to relate. I have told you what the <hi>ſobereſt</hi> among them ſay; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo abſurd as what ſome of them would have us believe.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:55119:20"/>
               <p>'Tis no hard matter to diſprove theſe conceits, and ſhew how groundleſs they are; for no body ever yet got near enough to the <hi>Planets,</hi> to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf whether they are really of the ſame nature with <hi>Metals,</hi> or whether any <hi>Effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> of bodies do fall from them to us.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs ſome can conceit that theſe things are proved by <hi>Experience;</hi> but in truth there's nothing to confirm their Opinion, and we find it every day plain enough, that the Faculties and Virtues are utterly falſe, which they do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Metals;</hi> the <hi>Metals</hi> indeed are of good uſe in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and excellent <hi>Remedies</hi> may be drawn from them; but their effects may better be explicated by Cauſes near at hand than the <hi>Stars.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Another ſort of theſe men do take wonderful pains to find out the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> in <hi>Minerals,</hi> as in <hi>Antimony</hi> for example, thinking there's a

               <p>I ſhould never make an end of this ſubject, if I ſhould ſpeak of the labours, and pains, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, vexations and frettings, and eſpecially the coſt theſe unfortunate men do plunge themſelves into, in following their ſeveral fancies; they are ſo extremely prepoſſeſſed with the conceit of becoming <hi>Rich</hi> all of a ſudden, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uncapable of any ſober admonition, and they ſhut their ears to any thing than can be ſaid to diſabuſe them; ſo that all other <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that are not beſotted with their fantaſtical opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are by them thought and called <hi>Prophane,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to themſelves the name of the only <hi>True Philoſophers,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers paramount.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſaddeſt conſideration of all is, to ſee a great many of them, who have ſpent all the flower of their years, in this deſperate concern,

                  <hi>Gold</hi> taken inwardly is thought to be a moſt potent <hi>Cordial,</hi> becauſe <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> tell us it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its <hi>Influence</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is as it were the <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of thoſe <hi>Influences</hi> to the <hi>Heart,</hi> it ſerves to fortifie and cleanſe it from all impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; upon which ground a great many Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been invented in order to open this <hi>Metal,</hi> and ſeparate its <hi>Sulphur</hi> from its <hi>Salt.</hi> Moreover this Operation by way of bravery is called <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> becauſe this <hi>Salt</hi> or this <hi>Sulphur</hi> diſſolving in a Liquor, can be taken by way of <hi>Potion:</hi> And becauſe this <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile</hi> can be thought to be diſtributed into all parts of the body, they fancy it can drive out every thing that interrupts the Functions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it can free him that takes it from all fear of any Diſeaſes for a long time, and can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long life.</p>
               <p>But this Opinion is built upon a weak foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and Experience does not confirm any of theſe great effects; for what aſſurance can one have or what Evidence is there, that the <hi>Sun</hi> is ſuch a great friend of <hi>Gold,</hi> or that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows more <hi>Influences</hi> on it, than other mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; 'tis a thing that can never be prov'd, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55119:23"/>we ſee that the <hi>Sun</hi> caſts it light and heat in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral upon all bodies, without making any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Who can underſtand, that the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> are ſo diſpoſed, as to have a greater facility of retaining the <hi>Suns Influences,</hi> than other <hi>Metals</hi> or things? This will be full as hard to prove as the other.</p>
               <p>But though we ſhould grant the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> this ſuppoſition concerning the <hi>Suns Influence</hi> on <hi>Gold,</hi> the conſequence they draw from it, that therefore it <hi>Fortifies</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> would be ne're a whit the truer; for all that we are able to apprehend in <hi>Gold</hi> is, that it is a moſt compact and weighty body, the union of whoſe <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> is extraordinary cloſe; which is proved from hence, that no Art can inſtruct us to diſſolve it <hi>Radically,</hi> ſo as to ſeparate its <hi>ſalt,</hi> and its <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</hi> This <hi>Gold</hi> being beaten into the thinneſt <hi>Leaves</hi> that can be imagined, and taken inwardly receives not the leaſt change in our bodies, and is voided the very ſame it was before, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when <hi>Quicksylver</hi> has been taken before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, for it unites with that, as I have ſaid.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt conclude, that if <hi>Gold</hi> has received more <hi>Influence</hi> from the <hi>Sun</hi> than other <hi>Metals,</hi> yet it is never the fitter to diſſolve in our Bodies, nor to produce thoſe rare effects that are talkt of.</p>
               <p>I know that <hi>ſtories</hi> are told to prove, that <hi>Gold</hi> does communicate virtue to the bodies of thoſe who have taken it, and that it loſes in the body ſome of its quantity; and among other <hi>ſtories</hi> 'tis ſaid, that ſeveral perſons, who had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55119:23"/>fed upon <hi>Capons,</hi> nouriſhed with a <hi>Paſte</hi> made of a mixture of <hi>Vipers</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> together, have been cured that way of ſeveral <hi>Diſeaſes;</hi> but there's a great deal more reaſon to attribute this effect rather to the <hi>Vipers</hi> than <hi>Gold;</hi> for we know by experience that <hi>Vipers</hi> taken inwardly without any thing elſe, do uſe to produce di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſenſible effects, whereas we obſerve none at all in <hi>Gold,</hi> when 'tis given alone.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Loſs</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> in bodies, they prove it by their gathering together all the <hi>Excrements</hi> of thoſe <hi>Capons,</hi> and <hi>Calcining</hi> them, for they could obtain again but the fourth part of the <hi>Gold</hi> that was uſed in the <hi>Paſte</hi> the <hi>Capons</hi> had fed upon. But this proof is as weak as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for the <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>Capons</hi> being full of a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> that <hi>Salt</hi> may have <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliz'd</hi> and carried away the greateſt part of the <hi>Gold</hi> during the <hi>Calcination,</hi> after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we ſee ſeveral <hi>Volatile</hi> liquors to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Gold.</hi> I know well enough by my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that there are ſuch <hi>Volatiles</hi> as are able to carry away <hi>Gold;</hi> for having one day mixed three ounces of <hi>Gold</hi> with about three pounds of matter conſiſting of diverſe <hi>Volatile Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;</hi> I put the mixture about a moneth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the <hi>Coppell,</hi> and the <hi>Gold</hi> appeared very reſplendent in the middle of the mixture; but blowing, as we uſe to do, in its purification, I was aſtoniſhed to ſee it <hi>Exalt</hi> away by little and little into the <hi>air,</hi> until there was not a <hi>grain</hi> of it left.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:55119:24"/>
               <p>Thus no body can be aſſured that <hi>Gold</hi> did nouriſh thoſe <hi>Capons;</hi> but beſides, though ſome of it ſhould be diſſolved in the body, as it does in <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> which is very hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; though ſome of it ſhould <hi>exalt,</hi> nay though ſome ſhould plainly glitter in the <hi>Chyle,</hi> here's no proof nevertheleſs that it produces ſuch wonderful effects.</p>
               <p>Now although I have aſſerted that <hi>Gold</hi> taken alone does not receive any change as for health, yet I value very much ſeveral preparations of <hi>Gold</hi> made with <hi>Spirits;</hi> for 'tis theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> that give certain determinations to <hi>Gold</hi> according to their nature, and make it operate as it does. When I ſpeak of <hi>Aurum Fulminans,</hi> I ſhall give an inſtance of what I now ſay.</p>

               </head>
               <p>You muſt uſe a large <hi>Bolt-head</hi> to diſſolve the <hi>Biſmuth</hi> in, becauſe the great <hi>Ebullition</hi> that happens, as ſoon as <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> is caſt upon it, requires room to move in. You muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have a care, as much as you can, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Vapours</hi> at your Noſe or Mouth, for they are very offenſive to the breaſt.</p>
               <p>This quick and violent <hi>Ebullition</hi> proceeds from the <hi>acids</hi> quick penetration of the large pores of <hi>Biſmuth</hi> as ſoon as thrown upon it, and the <hi>acid</hi> violently divides all that oppoſes its motion. It happens alſo that the <hi>Bolt-head</hi> grows ſo hot, that one can't endure ones hand upon it, becauſe the points of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> do chafe againſt the ſolid body of <hi>Biſmuth</hi> with ſuch force, that you may obſerve from thence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55119:25"/>much the ſame heat, as when two ſolid bodies are rub'd againſt one another. Add to this, that the great ſtore of igneous particles contained in <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> may much increaſe this heat.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> becomes turbid through ſome impurities in the <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> you muſt pour into it about twice as much <hi>Water</hi> and filter it; for if you ſhould go to filter it without Water, it would <hi>coagulate</hi> like <hi>ſalt</hi> in the <hi>Filter,</hi> and not paſs through. This <hi>Coagulation</hi> proceeds from the <hi>acid ſpirits</hi> of <hi>Niter</hi> that are included in the particles, of <hi>Biſmuth,</hi> which finding too little liquor to ſwim in and diſperſe, do gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into <hi>Cryſtals,</hi> when the <hi>diſſolution</hi> is <hi>cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Magiſtery</hi> may be made by pouring in great quantity of Fountain water without any <hi>ſalt,</hi> into the <hi>diſſolution,</hi> but it is made the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when you uſe <hi>ſalt,</hi> and the <hi>Precipitation</hi> is the better becauſe <hi>ſalt</hi> does encounter and break ſome of the <hi>acids</hi> that <hi>water</hi> alone was not able to weaken ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>Now ſome difficulty appears here in conceiving how <hi>plain water</hi> alone comes to <hi>precipitate Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth, Lead, Antimony,</hi> which the <hi>acid</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, and yet can do nothing at all to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitating Gold, Sylver,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of ſome <hi>ſalt</hi> or other body; I do imagine that the former having large <hi>Pores, Acids</hi> can ſtick ſo cloſe in them that <hi>water</hi> may force them out; but <hi>Gold, Silver,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> having finer <hi>Pores</hi> in compariſon than the other, do retain <hi>acids</hi> ſo very cloſely that the weak impulſes of water alone can make no

                  <p>There happens an obſervation in the <hi>Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> as well as ſeveral other things, which very well deſerves ſome reflection. 'Tis that although the <hi>Sulphurous</hi> or <hi>Volatile</hi> parts of <hi>Lead</hi> fly away in the <hi>Calcination,</hi> which loſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55119:26"/>ſhould indeed make it weigh the leſs, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs after a long <hi>Calcining</hi> 'tis found, that inſtead of loſing it increaſes in weight.</p>
                  <p>Some trying to explicate this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> do ſay, that as long as the violence of the flame does open and divide the parts of the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> the <hi>acid</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> or other matter that burns, does inſinuate into the pores of this <hi>Calx,</hi> where 'tis ſtopt or fixt by the <hi>Alkali;</hi> but this reaſon will not hold, when 'tis conſidered that this <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> comes to paſs as well when <hi>Lead</hi> is <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd</hi> with <hi>Coals</hi> as <hi>Wood,</hi> for <hi>Coals</hi> contain only a fixt <hi>Salt</hi> that riſes not at all.</p>
                  <p>'Tis better therefore to refer this effect to the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>pores</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> in ſuch a manner, that part of the fire inſinuating into them does there remain imbodied, and can't get forth again, whence the weight comes to be encreaſed.</p>
                  <p>If you would revive this <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> by way of <hi>Fuſion,</hi> its parts do ſqueez and expreſs the igneous particles that were incloſed, and the <hi>Lead</hi> does thereby weigh leſs than it did when reduced into a <hi>Calx,</hi> for by this means the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous</hi> parts are ſeparated and loſt.</p>

                  <p>If you uſe ſix ounces of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> in your <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> you'l draw an Ounce and ſix drachms of liquor, and there will remain in the

                     <hi>Retort</hi> ſix ounces and ſix drachms of a blackiſh and yellow matter; and if you put this matter into a <hi>Crucible,</hi> ſetting it in the fire, 'twill melt, and you'l regain four ounces of <hi>Lead,</hi> and half an ounce, or it may be ſix drachms of a yellow earth coloured like <hi>Litharge of Gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis evident from this Operation that an ounce and ſix drachms of the more Acid parts of <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> are ſufficient to impregnate four ounces and two drachms of <hi>Lead,</hi> to reduce it into <hi>Salt;</hi> but the ſtrangeſt thing that happens to it, is the great change that <hi>Acids</hi> do give it, inſomuch that 'tis not to be known again in the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Augmentation</hi> that the <hi>Lead</hi> in the <hi>Retort</hi> does here receive, is as plain as may be; for ſix drachms are taken out of it at laſt, more than were put in of <hi>Salt of Saturn,</hi> beſides an ounce and ſix drachms of liquor that were drawn out. So that we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that the four ounces and two drachms of <hi>Lead</hi> are grown encreaſed two ounces and an half.</p>
                  <p>'Tis probable enough that the more rarified the <hi>Lead</hi> becomes, the more capable 'twill be of igneous particles; for although the <hi>Salt of Saturn</hi> is not ſuffer'd to remain long in the fire, yet the <hi>Lead</hi> encreaſes apace. Poſſibly it may be that as faſt as the <hi>Acids</hi> go out of it, igneous bodies enter in their place, and open like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> by their nimble motion; but theſe <hi>Pores</hi> muſt needs be ſo diſpoſed as to ſhut again like valvules, and hinder the return back of thoſe fiery parts.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55119:27"/>
                  <p>When this <hi>Calx</hi> is <hi>Calcined</hi> in an open fire in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> without ſtirring it, the parts of <hi>Lead</hi> cloſe together and expel the fiery particles, ſo that the <hi>Lead revives</hi> as it was before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers its <hi>Natural</hi> gravity.</p>
                  <p>The matter when ſhut up in the <hi>Retort</hi> would never be able to <hi>revive,</hi> let the fire be made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrong, becauſe the igneous particles would find no liberty to get out.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Yellow earth</hi> that's found in the <hi>Crucible</hi> ſeems to be of a Golden colour, 'tis a terreſtrious and bituminous impurity that the <hi>Lead</hi> is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from.

               <p>Becauſe <hi>Copper</hi> contains in it a <hi>Corroſive</hi> quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I would adviſe no body to uſe it <hi>inwardly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Copper</hi> takes <hi>Ruſt</hi> very eaſily, for if you leave but a drop of <hi>Water</hi> ſome hours upon a piece of it, it creates a <hi>Verdegreaſe.</hi> Have a care of <hi>drinking</hi> water, that has lain in <hi>Copper</hi> veſſels, for it always diſſolves ſome portion of it, which appears eaſily from the taſte it leaves in it.</p>
               <p>'Twill not be altogether amiſs to make mention here of an effect that is no leſs ſtrange than uſual. 'Tis that <hi>Water</hi> or any other liquor that's heated
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55119:27"/>or boil'd in a <hi>Copper</hi> veſſel for a whole day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſavours not at all, or not ſo much of the <hi>Copper,</hi> provided 'tis not remov'd off the fire all the time, as other <hi>Water</hi> warm'd in a like veſſel, and put from the fire but an hour; for whereas <hi>water</hi> alone can diſſolve ſomething of the <hi>Copper,</hi> it would ſeem that being aided with the heat of the fire, it ſhould partake of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the more eaſily. Now in my opinion this is the moſt rational explication that can be given of this matter.</p>
               <p>Every body may perceive that when the <hi>water</hi> begins to heat in a Baſon or other <hi>Copper</hi> veſſel, that's ſet over the fire, little <hi>Atoms</hi> do riſe at bottom like the ſtirring of a powder, and theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> do encreaſe according as the <hi>water</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives more <hi>heat,</hi> ſo that at length they make it boil a high; theſe little <hi>Atoms</hi> can have no other <hi>cauſe</hi> than the <hi>fiery particles,</hi> which paſſing through the Baſon, do drive the <hi>water</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards apace, and rarifie its parts; for this reaſon 'tis that the <hi>water</hi> is not able to diſſolve any of the <hi>Copper,</hi> for being continually raiſed upwards, it can make no impreſſion upon the bottom of the Baſon.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſome will tell me, the liquor might take the impreſſion of the <hi>Copper,</hi> at the ſides of the Baſon; but it is eaſie to imagine that though there don't paſs through the ſides ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fiery particles as do at the bottom, there do paſs nevertheleſs enough to hinder the liquor from ſticking to or diſſolving any particles of the veſſel.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55119:28"/>
               <p>But now on the contrary the Baſon being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from off the fire, and the motion of the igneous particles being quite ceaſed, the liquor impregnates of the <hi>Coppery</hi> nature with eaſe, nay and ſo much the more eaſily as the fire has rarified the metal, and rendred it the more proper for diſſolution.</p>
               <p>Every thing ſeems to confirm this Opinion, for if any liquor is put boiling over a ſtrong fire in a <hi>Copper</hi> veſſel, 'twill not impregnate in the leaſt, but if you place it upon a ſmall fire, and leave it ſo for ſome time, then becauſe there will not paſs enough fiery particles, to cover all the ſurface of the veſſel, and raiſe up the liquor, 'twill take ſome taſte of <hi>Copper;</hi> but this taſte will not be ſo ſtrong as if you had left it the ſame length of time in ſuch a veſſel off the fire, after it had been warm'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liquors</hi> that are full of <hi>Salts</hi> do take the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Copper</hi> much more eaſily than thoſe that are not. Thus <hi>Confectioners</hi> do take notice of what I have mentioned; for though they boil their <hi>Confections</hi> in veſſels of <hi>Copper</hi> for a conſiderable time, they find 'em taſte nothing of the <hi>Copper,</hi> but they know that if they ſhould leave them but half an hour in the veſſel taken off the fire, they would be tainted with a moſt loathſom <hi>Copper</hi> taſte.</p>
               <p>We may learn from this Diſcourſe, not to uſe a <hi>Copper</hi> veſſel, when we have a mind to boil or heat a liquor gently, and when we do think fit to uſe it, to be ſure to keep a good brisk fire underneath, and not to let what we have boil'd,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55119:28"/>cool afterwards in a veſſel of this nature.</p>
               <p>Another difficulty does here offer it ſelf on this ſubject, and it is to know why a <hi>Kettle</hi> that has been taken off the fire, is not ſo hot at <hi>bottom</hi> as at the <hi>ſides,</hi> ſo that aſſoon as 'tis removed from off the fire, one may touch it at bottom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out burning ones finger, which can't de done at the ſides without preſent ſcalding.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of which is, that the fiery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles tending upwards through the bottom of the <hi>kettle,</hi> which is flat, in a direct line, don't make any ſtop in paſſing through, having but a little diſtance to conquer before they come into the liquor; but thoſe that riſe on the ſides, finding a longer ſpace to make upon the <hi>kettle,</hi> do many of them ſtop in the pores of the <hi>Copper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not the ſame thing in Kettles that are made in another form, whoſe bottom is Globular, becauſe the fiery particles riſing up in an indirect line, do find more to do to paſs it through, than in a flat bottom, and ſo by conſequence more of them do ſtop in the veſſel it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yellow Copper</hi> is a mixture of <hi>Lapis Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris</hi> and <hi>Copper,</hi> and veſſels that are made of it give leſs impreſſion to liquors than the others.</p>

               <p>Seeing ſome perſons have pleaſed to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the <hi>Remarks</hi> I have made upon the Effects of <hi>Mars,</hi> and particularly concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I have given <hi>Iron</hi> to <hi>Steel</hi> for Phyſical uſes, I have thought it not convenient to end this Chapter, before I have laid down and Anſwered all their Objections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then they ſay, that becauſe the different ſubſtances of <hi>Mars</hi> cannot be ſeparated, as thoſe of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables</hi> can, 'tis in vain an <hi>Aperitive</hi> virtue is attributed to its <hi>Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I grant all the ſubſtances of <hi>Mars</hi> can't be ſeparated ſo eaſily as thoſe of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables;</hi> but becauſe we find <hi>Salts</hi> to be <hi>Aperitive,</hi> and commonly Remedies that are ſo, are full of <hi>Salts,</hi> and that <hi>water</hi> in which <hi>Ruſt</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> has ſteeped for ſome time, is proper to open by way of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> it ſeems to me rational enough to attribute this effect of <hi>Mars</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to its <hi>Salt;</hi> for if the <hi>water</hi> has carried off any taſte or penetrating quality from <hi>Iron,</hi> there's nothing at all in <hi>Mars</hi> that is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſuch a virtue to it, beſides the <hi>Salt</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in diſſolved.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:55119:30"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> they ſay, the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> being united and in a manner <hi>inſeparable,</hi> cannot act but by conſent of both, and receive together joyntly the good or bad impreſſions, that may happen to them.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> there's no reaſon to think the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> abſolutely <hi>inſeparable</hi> from the <hi>Earth,</hi> for the <hi>water</hi> in which this Metal has ſteeped or boiled, after <hi>Filtration</hi> does contain a <hi>Vitriolick</hi> taſte, and <hi>Aperitive</hi> quality. Now 'tis the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Salt</hi> to diſſolve imperceptibly in Water and drive by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> as I have ſaid; but if any body would take the pains to ſteep and boil gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly the <hi>ruſt</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> a good while in <hi>water,</hi> then <hi>Filter</hi> it, and ſo <hi>Evaporate</hi> the liquor over a ſmall fire to a <hi>Pellicule,</hi> he'l by <hi>Cryſtalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation</hi> or by an entire <hi>evaporation</hi> of the humidity, gain a ſmall quantity of <hi>Salt;</hi> and 'tis probable enough there was much more in the <hi>water,</hi> as may be collected from the ſtrong taſte it had of <hi>Mars,</hi> but it being of a pretty <hi>Volatile</hi> nature, if fum'd away in the <hi>Evaporation.</hi> I do not ſay nevertheleſs that the cloſe connexion of <hi>Earth</hi> with the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> is altogether unuſeful for this effect; on the contrary, I do conceive that this <hi>Earth</hi> rendring the <hi>Salt</hi> more heavy than otherwiſe it would be, does help to drive it forwards, and cauſes the <hi>Mars</hi> ſometimes to penetrate as much by its gravity as by its <hi>Salt;</hi> but we muſt attribute the principal virtue to the Vehicle which is <hi>Salt,</hi> ſince without that, the <hi>Earth</hi> would be a dead matter, and would have no more action than other <hi>Earths</hi> bereaved of their <hi>Salts.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They object, we muſt not think the <hi>hardneſs</hi> of the parts of <hi>Steel</hi> above <hi>Iron,</hi> whoſe <hi>Pores</hi> are more <hi>open,</hi> does render it leſs proper for all ſorts of Preparations, ſeeing <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> and many other <hi>Acids</hi> are found to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve with the ſame eaſe both <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Steel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> that if <hi>Corroſive Spirits</hi> do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve <hi>Steel,</hi> they can diſſolve <hi>Iron</hi> more eaſily; and whereas a ſmaller quantity of them can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon <hi>Iron</hi> than <hi>Steel,</hi> a better effect does thence follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis <hi>objected</hi> that the <hi>ſolidity</hi> of <hi>Steel</hi> may be an advantageous circumſtance to it, for the better fixing the diſſolving <hi>Juices</hi> that are in the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> and that for <hi>Metals</hi> the <hi>pure</hi> are to be choſen before thoſe that are not ſo.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> that inſtead of the <hi>ſolidity</hi> of <hi>Steels</hi> being helpful to the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> 'tis certainly of great prejudice to it, as well as to thoſe other parts 'tis diſtributed into; for the <hi>juices</hi> that are found in the <hi>ſtomach</hi> being but <hi>weak diſſolvents,</hi> are not able to penetrate nor rarifie this <hi>metal,</hi> if it is too hard; ſo that they leave it crude and indigeſt, heavy and incommodious to this part: Wherefore it paſſes away by Stool, without any good effect, as often happens. But now if a little of this <hi>Steel</hi> does happen to paſs along with the <hi>Chyle,</hi> it rather cauſes than takes away <hi>Obſtructions,</hi> for by inſinuating into ſmall veſſels, it ſtops in the narrow paſſages, and cauſes grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pains.</p>
               <p>For what is ſaid concerning the <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> it is of great uſe to Tradeſmen, for they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55119:31"/>by <hi>Purifying metals</hi> from their more rarified and <hi>Volatile</hi> parts, do make them the leſs <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> and ſo the leſs liable to ſuffer prejudice from the Air or time. Thus <hi>Steel</hi> is much fitter for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils</hi> than <hi>Iron,</hi> becauſe its <hi>Pores</hi> are cloſer laid together, and it takes not <hi>ruſt</hi> ſo ſoon as <hi>Iron;</hi> but in <hi>Remedies</hi> 'tis not the ſame thing, for thoſe <hi>metals</hi> that are more <hi>Rarified,</hi> and are eaſilier diſſolved in the Body, are ſuch as we find beſt effects from, for the reaſon I have given. So that what <hi>Workmen</hi> call <hi>Purity,</hi> is often but an <hi>impurity</hi> in <hi>Remedies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They ſay, if one would hope to find a diſtinct <hi>Salt</hi> in <hi>Mars,</hi> 'twould be more likely to find it in that which is <hi>Purified,</hi> than in the <hi>Faeces</hi> which are ſeparated from it, and which are indeed but the <hi>Impurities</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> that <hi>Steel</hi> is made of.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> there would be ſome reaſon to think that <hi>Salt</hi> might be more eaſily found in <hi>Steel</hi> than <hi>Iron,</hi> if in the making of <hi>Steel, Iron</hi> were ſimply <hi>Calcined,</hi> without adding <hi>Nails</hi> and <hi>Horns</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> in the <hi>Calcination;</hi> for then it might be ſaid that the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> being in part evaporated, its <hi>ſalt</hi> would be the more <hi>Soluble:</hi> but we muſt conſider that the <hi>Volatile Salts</hi> which come from theſe parts of <hi>Animals,</hi> being piercing <hi>Alkali's,</hi> do deſtroy the <hi>Acid ſalts</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> and do thereby render the <hi>Steel</hi> more compact, and unfit to take <hi>ruſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſalts</hi> which by their motion did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the <hi>metal,</hi> are fixed, and as it were <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and have not the capaciay of acting as they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55119:31"/>did. This is the reaſon why a <hi>Plate</hi> of <hi>Steel</hi> that has infuſed in Water will not give ſo great Impreſſion to it, as a <hi>Plate</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> Calcined, of the ſame weight, infuſing the ſame time, will do.</p>
               <p>Another thing remarkable in the <hi>Calcination</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> to turn it into <hi>Steel,</hi> is that it is thereby deprived of its more <hi>Volatile ſalt,</hi> which ſhould have moſt effect with it, in hopes to free it from <hi>Impurities,</hi> and that which is called the <hi>Scories,</hi> is the better part of <hi>Iron</hi> that has been rarified by its <hi>ſalt.</hi> Thus for the ſame reaſon that ſome are pleaſed to call the <hi>ruſt</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> its <hi>droſs,</hi> the whole <hi>metal</hi> may deſerve the ſame appellation, all of it being capable of <hi>ruſting,</hi> if it is but laid in the open air.</p>

               <p>I could attribute the invention of this diſcourſe to my ſelf, being the very firſt that thus treated of this matter in <hi>France,</hi> and maintained it in <hi>publick meetings;</hi> but I am not poſſeſſed with that vanity of <hi>Authors,</hi> I leave it to thoſe that love it: I had no affectation to make a <hi>Book on purpoſe</hi> concerning it, but have only mentioned it as a thing incident to the Subject I treated of.

               <p>Thoſe who deſire to be further inſtructed upon this Subject may read <hi>Monſieur Blegny</hi>'s <hi>Book</hi> Treating of <hi>Venereal diſtempers.</hi> 'Twas Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Engliſh</hi> 3 or 4 years ago, and Printed for Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi> the Bookſeller under S. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Some thinking to invalidate what I eſtabliſhed in the <hi>firſt Edition</hi> of my <hi>Book,</hi> do ſay that <hi>mercury</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be abſolutely called an <hi>alkali,</hi> becauſe the <hi>alkali</hi> that is in <hi>mercury</hi> is but one part of its Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is not to be ſeparated from its other parts.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Anſwer</hi> this difficulty you need but only read in the <hi>Remarks</hi> that I have made upon the <hi>Principles,</hi> how it is I do <hi>explicate</hi> the nature of an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and you'l find that although the name <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali</hi> comes from the <hi>Salt</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> called <hi>Kali,</hi> that is, <hi>ſoapwort,</hi> yet all bodies that cauſe a ſudden <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> with <hi>Acids</hi> are called <hi>Alkali's,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any need of their containing any <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> within.

I ſhall ſpeak ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to ſome of the Principal ones.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55119:32"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is <hi>Objected</hi> that if <hi>Mercury</hi> is an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi> and the <hi>Venereal</hi> venom an <hi>Acid,</hi> this ſame <hi>Acid</hi> ſhould certainly <hi>fix</hi> it, whereas the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of it that are made by the <hi>Juyces,</hi> do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve to encreaſe its <hi>Volatility,</hi> and render it <hi>Corroſive,</hi> inſtead of being at all <hi>ſweetned</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> it is as falſe to ſay, that <hi>Mercury</hi> is <hi>Volatilized</hi> by the <hi>Acid Juices</hi> of the <hi>Venereal</hi> venom, as it is that <hi>Mercury</hi> mixed with <hi>Acid Spirits</hi> to render it <hi>Corroſive,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> by the ſame <hi>Spirits.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>Mercury</hi> alone does eaſily <hi>Volatilize</hi> by the heat of the body, and nothing but <hi>Acids</hi> are able to fix it at all. I thought I had ſufficiently expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated my ſelf as to this when I ſaid that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Mercury,</hi> finding not in the body enough <hi>Acid Spirits</hi> to fix it, does paſs by <hi>Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Corroſive</hi> nature that <hi>Mercury</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, we muſt attribute it to the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of its <hi>Pores,</hi> and the abundance of <hi>Acid</hi> points it impregnates with, and ſeeing it will not ſweeten the <hi>Acidity</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> with which it is mixed to make a <hi>Sublimate Corroſive,</hi> why ſhould we expect it to ſweeten the <hi>Acid juices</hi> of the body? I do not pretend nevertheleſs that it never <hi>Dulcifies</hi> at all; for I do conceive it may deſtroy much of their force by dividing and breaking their points, when the <hi>Acids</hi> are but few, as does happen in <hi>Mercurius dubois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Objected</hi> that if the venom of the <hi>Pox</hi> were an <hi>Acid,</hi> it might then be Cured by the uſe of <hi>Alkali Salts,</hi> either <hi>fixt</hi> or <hi>Volatile,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:55119:33"/>as by <hi>Crabs-Eyes, Perles, Corals,</hi> and ſuch like bodies as are wont to kill and ſweeten <hi>Acid</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> we often find that <hi>Volatile ſalts</hi> do give ſome eaſe to thoſe that are troubled with the <hi>Venereal diſtemper,</hi> whether it be by <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Pores,</hi> and ſo making the ſubtler part of it perſpire away, or that by being <hi>Alkali's,</hi> they do <hi>abſorbe</hi> ſome part of it. For this reaſon ſome do uſe to give their Patients the <hi>Volatile Salt of Vipers</hi> ſeveral mornings together, but theſe <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali's</hi> are in truth of too weak a nature to carry off ſuch an <hi>Acidity,</hi> after they are impregnated with it, as <hi>Mercury</hi> is able to do without loſing its nature. They are <hi>Nets</hi> of too fine a make, to catch ſuch keen and active bodies; if theſe <hi>Salts</hi> do deſtroy ſome part of the <hi>Acidity,</hi> they deſtroy themſelves likewiſe in the conflict, that they can have no further operation, wherefore there's need of a more powerful <hi>Volatile Alkali</hi> than theſe <hi>Salts</hi> are, to eradicate the <hi>Acidity</hi> of <hi>Venereal Poyſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Fixt Salts</hi> and <hi>Alkali</hi> bodies, as <hi>Perle, Coral, Crabs-eyes,</hi> whereas they have no <hi>Volatile</hi> quality in them, and their tendency is wholly downwards, 'tis very uncertain whether ever they reach to <hi>Venereal tumors</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly riſe in the <hi>Joints,</hi> by reaſon of the long way they have to paſs thither, and the <hi>Juices</hi> they have to encounter in their paſſage, which may in all likelihood change their nature; but ſuppoſe they were carried to thoſe <hi>Tumors</hi> with the ſame qualifications they were taken with,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55119:33"/>they would only ſerve to weaken a little this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity,</hi> without being able to carry it off, and ſo they would only give a little eaſe, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving <hi>Radically</hi> the <hi>Ferment</hi> of the Diſtemper, as <hi>Mercury</hi> is able to do.</p>

               <p>Thoſe who have thought fit to Criticize upon what I have ſaid about the effects of <hi>Mercury,</hi> would methinks, have ſpoken more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than they have done, if they had objected to me a difficulty that I have made to my ſelf ſince the firſt <hi>Edition</hi> of my Book. 'Tis this, If the <hi>Mercury</hi> that is given in order to raiſe a <hi>Flux,</hi> does joyn with the <hi>Acid ſalt</hi> of the humors, and ſo makes a <hi>Sublimate Corroſive,</hi> after the ſame manner as 'tis made in the <hi>Matraſs,</hi> when 'tis mixt with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol;</hi> this <hi>Sublimate</hi> of the body can't be perfected, as long as there is any watry humor in the part, wherein <hi>Mercury</hi> is mixt with <hi>Acids;</hi> juſt as none of it can be made in a <hi>Matraſs,</hi> until all the <hi>Phlegm</hi> that's in it, is evaporated away. Now it is not to be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55119:34"/>conceived, that there ſhould ever happen ſuch a Deſiccation to the body, for it would be <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> by <hi>Mercury</hi> loaded with <hi>Acids,</hi> before it could <hi>Sublime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To anſwer this Objection I ſay, That although I have made a compariſon between the <hi>ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>mercury</hi> that's made in the body, and that which is done in a <hi>Matraſs;</hi> nevertheleſs there is this difference between them, that the firſt is not only made with <hi>Salts</hi> extremely <hi>Volatile,</hi> but is likewiſe aſſiſted or carried on by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humours with all their humidity up to the Head, whereas this other is made with <hi>Fixt Salts,</hi> whoſe <hi>Acidity</hi> is ſo ſtrongly rooted in the Earthy part, that it can't be ſeparated from it, without a very conſiderable fire.</p>
               <p>Nor muſt we think that the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the body is loaded with as many and as ſtrong <hi>Acids,</hi> as that in the <hi>Matraſs;</hi> for if it were ſo, it would carry deſtruction, and cauſe a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> whereſoever it came; but it is enough, that its <hi>Pores</hi> are in part impregnated with them, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to diminiſh a little of its <hi>Volatility,</hi> and cauſe thoſe prickings and pains which do happen during the <hi>Salivation.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>Many Authors have thought they could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe mainly the <hi>Redneſs</hi> of this <hi>Precipitate,</hi> by <hi>Cohobating</hi> it, or diſtilling <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> three times upon the <hi>white maſs;</hi> but I have found by experience in both theſe ways of Operation that theſe Circumſtances are to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>white Maſs</hi> which remains after Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the humidity is a mixture of <hi>Mercury</hi> with a great many <hi>Acid Spirits,</hi> for it weighs three ounces more than the <hi>Mercury</hi> did which was diſſolved; it is extreme <hi>Corroſive,</hi> and fiery, if applied to the fleſh, but according as it is <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined</hi> in order to make it <hi>Red,</hi> the edges of the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> which cauſed the <hi>Corroſion</hi> do paſs off, and fly into the Air; whence it comes to paſs, that the more we deſire to encreaſe the <hi>Redneſs</hi> in the <hi>Calcination,</hi> the leſs it weighs, and the leſs it corrodes. Some <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> obſerving this effect do chooſe the <hi>Precipitate</hi> that is not ſo <hi>Red</hi> as uſual, when they would make a quick <hi>Eſchar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſtill continue the fire ſome hours under the <hi>Red maſs,</hi> it will <hi>ſublime,</hi> and ſtill retain its
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55119:36"/>colour; this <hi>ſublimate</hi> is not ſo <hi>Corroſive</hi> as the other; which makes me think that the points of <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> are neceſſary to make a <hi>ſublimate</hi> very <hi>Corroſive.</hi> The reaſon why it will <hi>ſublime,</hi> is becauſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> being diſcharged of a great many <hi>Acid Spirits,</hi> that held it <hi>fixed,</hi> has power to riſe with thoſe that remain. But becauſe theſe remaining <hi>Spirits</hi> do moderate a little its <hi>Volatility,</hi> it makes a ſtop in the middle of the <hi>Viol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some do put <hi>Red Precipitate</hi> into an Earthen Pot, and pour upon it <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> well <hi>Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> then fire it, and when the <hi>Spirit</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, they add more, and burn it as before; they repeat <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and burn it ſix times together, and then they call this Preparation <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum Corallinum.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does carry off ſome edges of the <hi>Precipitate</hi> and joyns it ſelf to the reſt, ſo that this <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> is ſweetned and rendred fit to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
               <p>If by way of curioſity you pour <hi>Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> upon common <hi>Red Precipitate,</hi> ſuch as I have deſcribed, a <hi>Diſſolution</hi> will ſoon follow, becauſe <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> joyning with the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> that remained in the <hi>Precipitate,</hi> an <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> muſt happen from their union, which is able to diſſolve imperceptibly the parts of <hi>Mercury;</hi> but this Diſſolution will happen without any <hi>Ebullition,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> has been already rarified by an <hi>acid,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> does only diſſolve them without making any commotion. The <hi>Diſſolution</hi> is <hi>clear</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:55119:36"/>like other Diſſolutions of <hi>Mercury,</hi> without any manner of appearance of <hi>Redneſs,</hi> and the ſame Preparations may be made with it as are uſed to be done by the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of <hi>Quicksylver</hi> in <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If inſtead of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> you pour <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> upon the <hi>Red Precipitate,</hi> it turns pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into a curious <hi>white,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Spirit of ſalt</hi> breaks the force of the <hi>Spirit of Niter</hi> that was in the <hi>Red Precipitate;</hi> and the ſame thing muſt happen here as when <hi>Spirit of ſalt</hi> is poured upon the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of <hi>Quicksylver;</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Red Precipitate</hi> is a <hi>Dry</hi> body, yet it is nothing elſe but a mixture of <hi>Quicksylver,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Niter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the ſudden change of <hi>Colour,</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſomewhat ſtrange, that a matter which is grown <hi>Red</hi> by <hi>Calcination,</hi> ſhould in a minutes time turn ſo exceeding <hi>white.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Effect can be attributed only to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location which the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of <hi>ſalt</hi> does cauſe in the parts of <hi>Red Precipitate,</hi> and to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition it puts them anew into, ſo that their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> is put into a capacity of <hi>Reflecting</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> in a <hi>right line</hi> to our eyes, to give the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a <hi>white colour;</hi> for if by means of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſort of liquour or elſe by fire and ſome <hi>Alkali</hi> body, the Diſpoſition of the parts of your <hi>Precipitate</hi> is again changed, it will obtain ſome other Colour, or elſe it will return and <hi>revive</hi> into <hi>Quicksylver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you pour the <hi>Volatile ſpirit of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi> upon <hi>Red Precipitate,</hi> it turns into a <hi>grey</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:55119:37"/>powder, but if you throw a great deal of water upon it, it becomes a <hi>milk,</hi> though none of the whiteſt. The ſame thing happens, when you drop <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniack</hi> into the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of <hi>Quicksylver</hi> made with <hi>Spirit of Niter;</hi> for ſoon after the <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> is over, a <hi>grey</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſeen to <hi>Precipitate,</hi> and if you add to it water, it becomes a <hi>milk</hi> of the ſame whiteneſs as the other.</p>
               <p>Common <hi>Red Precipitate</hi> therefore is ſubject to the ſame alterations as the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> the <hi>Red colour</hi> giving no particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to it; which truly is a good proof that <hi>Colour</hi> is no <hi>real</hi> thing, but wholly depends upon the <hi>modification</hi> of the parts.</p>

                  <hi>Sublimate</hi> being <hi>mercury</hi> loaded with <hi>Acids,</hi> common <hi>water</hi> is able to diſſolve ſome of it, becauſe theſe <hi>Acids</hi> do rarifie it, and make a kind of <hi>ſalt</hi> of it; but becauſe there are not <hi>Acids</hi> enough in it to diſſolve all the <hi>mercury,</hi> the moſt compact part of it remains at bottom, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is filtred to clear and purifie it the more, it is as clear and tranſparent as Fountain water.</p>
               <p>If by further way of Curioſity, you ſhould drop into the Viol of <hi>Red precipitate,</hi> that I now deſcribed, ſome <hi>ſpirit of Sal Armoniack,</hi> and would ſhake the liquor a little, it would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55119:38"/>turn <hi>white,</hi> and your <hi>precipitate</hi> would be <hi>white;</hi> but if inſtead of <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniack</hi> you would uſe <hi>ſpirit of Vitriol,</hi> an <hi>Ebullition</hi> would riſe in it, and the <hi>Red</hi> liquor would become <hi>clear</hi> and tranſparent as common water.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> is an <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> diſſolved, it breaks the edges of the <hi>Acid</hi> which held up the <hi>mercury</hi> imperceptible, and ſerv'd as <hi>Swimmers</hi> to it in the Water, ſo that this <hi>mercury</hi> having nothing left to bear it up, muſt needs <hi>precipitate</hi> by its own weight. The ſame thing happens when the <hi>Spirit of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi> is thrown upon the other part of the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of <hi>ſublimate Corroſive.</hi> For this <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> being in like manner an <hi>Alkali,</hi> produces the ſame effect as the <hi>Oyl of Tartar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although <hi>Alkali's</hi> do all agree in this that they all break and deſtroy <hi>Acids,</hi> nevertheleſs there is always ſome difference in their action.</p>
               <p>And this evidently appears in thoſe differently coloured <hi>precipitates,</hi> for this diverſity can be attributed only to this, that they having in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral manners wrought upon <hi>Acids,</hi> do diſpoſe and <hi>modifie</hi> the parts of the <hi>precipitated</hi> body, ſo as they may be capable of making different <hi>Refractions</hi> of <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>precipitates</hi> are no longer <hi>poiſons,</hi> though they come from <hi>ſublimate Corroſive,</hi> and there's the ſame reaſon for it as there is for the <hi>precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;</hi> for ſeeing that which gave the <hi>Corroſion</hi> was an <hi>Acid,</hi> when this <hi>Acid</hi> is deſtroyed by ſuch powerful <hi>Alkali's</hi> as are the <hi>ſpirit of Sal Armoniack,</hi> and <hi>Oyl of Tartar,</hi> that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains muſt become <hi>ſweet.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Star</hi> which appears upon the <hi>Martial Regulus of Antimony</hi> when it is well <hi>Purified,</hi> has given occaſion to the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> to reaſon upon the matter; and the greateſt part of theſe men being ſtrongly perſwaded of the <hi>Planetary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,</hi> and a ſuppoſed correſpondence between each of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and the <hi>Metal</hi> that bears its name, they have not wanted to aſſert, that this ſame <hi>Star</hi> proceeded from the impreſſion which certain little bodies flowing from the <hi>Planet Mars</hi> do beſtow upon <hi>Antimony</hi> for ſake of the remaining <hi>Iron</hi> that was mixed with it; and for this reaſon, they wonderfully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the making this Preparation upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> rather than another day, between 7 and 8 a clock in the morning, or elſe between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, provided the weather be clear and fair, thinking that day which is denominated from <hi>Mars</hi> to be the time that it lets fall its <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> moſt plentiful of any. They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55119:40"/>conceited a thouſand things of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which 'twould be too much trouble to relate here.</p>
               <p>But all opinions of this kind have no manner of probability, for no bodies <hi>Experience</hi> did ever evince, that the <hi>Metals</hi> have any ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Planets,</hi> as I have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained otherwhere; much leſs can they prove that the <hi>Influences</hi> of the <hi>Planets</hi> do imprint ſuch and ſuch <hi>Figures</hi> to <hi>Metals,</hi> as theſe men do determine. It would be no hard matter for me here to ſhew how little reaſon or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is in diſcourſes of that nature, and how very weak and uncertain are the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Judicial Aſtrology;</hi> but this would be too long a <hi>Digreſſion</hi> for this place, and ſerve only to ſwell this Book with things that may be found treated of at large elſewhere, and particularly in the <hi>Epitome</hi> of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> made by <hi>Monſieur Bernier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My fancy therefore ſhall not ſoar ſo high as theſe mens do; and though I may ſeem dull and mean in their eyes, I ſhall not ſearch in the <hi>Coeleſtial Bodies</hi> for an explication of the <hi>Star</hi> we now contend about; ſeeing that I can find it out in cauſes near at hand. There have been who <hi>gazing</hi> too earneſtly upon the <hi>Stars</hi> above, have not perceived the <hi>ſtone</hi> at their feet, that cauſes them to <hi>ſtumble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay then that the <hi>Star</hi> which appears upon the <hi>Martial Regulus of Antimony,</hi> does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>Antimony</hi> it ſelf; for this Mineral runs all into <hi>Needles;</hi> but becauſe before it is

                  <hi>Purified,</hi> it is loaded with <hi>ſulphureous</hi> and impure parts, which make it ſoftiſh, theſe <hi>Needles</hi> do not appear but confuſedly. Now when it is <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi> with <hi>Mars,</hi> not only a great many of the more <hi>ſulphureous</hi> parts of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and ſuch as are fitteſt to hinder its <hi>Cryſtallization,</hi> are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, but alſo there remains the hardeſt and moſt compact part of the <hi>Iron,</hi> which makes the <hi>Antimony</hi> firmer than it was.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cryſtals</hi> then do appear in form of a <hi>ſtar</hi> in the <hi>Martial Regulus of Antimony,</hi> becauſe they were ſo <hi>Naturally</hi> in the <hi>Antimony</hi> before.

               </p>
               <p>Several other ways of preparing the <hi>Liver of antimony</hi> have been invented; but I am well enough ſatisfied in having given you the beſt of all, and the eaſieſt to prepare.</p>
               <p>If you uſe ordinary <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> in this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you'l obtain eight ounces and two drachms of <hi>Liver of antimony;</hi> but if you uſe <hi>Purified ſalt-peter,</hi> you'l get but ſix ounces and a half.</p>
               <p>This difference of quantity proceeds from the nature of <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> for the more <hi>Volatile</hi> parts this <hi>Mineral ſalt</hi> contains, the more apt it is to carry off ſome parts of the <hi>antimony.</hi> Now <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſalt-peter</hi> is much more <hi>Volatile</hi> than the common ſort, wherefore the <hi>Liver of antimony,</hi> where it is uſed, is in leſſer quantity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Liver of antimony</hi> that's made with common <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> is the <hi>Redder,</hi> and comes nearer to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of an <hi>Animals Liver,</hi> than that which is made with <hi>Purified ſalt-peter;</hi> this happens through the <hi>fixt-ſalt</hi> which is in this Preparation more than in the other; for common <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> contains much <hi>fixt ſalt,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew in its proper place; this <hi>ſalt</hi> does likewiſe make the matter the heavier.</p>
               <p>As for the virtues of, theſe <hi>Livers of antimony,</hi> the difference is not very great, but only that which is made with <hi>Purified ſalt-peter</hi> is a little more <hi>Emetick</hi> than the other.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:55119:41"/>
               <p>I cannot paſs by here the falſe imagination of ſome men, who think that Preparation of the <hi>Liver of antimony,</hi> of which half a drachm, or two ſcruples may be given, is much better than that whereof 3 or 4 grains perform the ſame effect; for there's no doubt but the taking ſo great a quantity of <hi>antimony</hi> will give an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> that a leſſer quantity is not able to do. Furthermore, ſeeing theſe Preparations do commonly open the <hi>antimony</hi> but little, or half fix the <hi>ſaline ſulphurs,</hi> it is to be feared leſt ſome <hi>ſalt</hi> they may meet with in the Stomach, ſhould open them too much, or <hi>Volatilize</hi> them, and ſo produce unhappy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>

               <p>When the <hi>ſtone,</hi> that <hi>Quick-lime</hi> is made of, is grown red hot in the Furnaces, the Workmen have a ſpecial care to keep up the fire at an equal height, until the <hi>ſtone</hi> is quite <hi>Calcin'd;</hi> for if the flame which has begun to burn among the ſtones, ſhould be ſuffered to leſſen for a while, and ſo the heat be check't before the end of the work, they would never afterwards be able to make <hi>Quick-lime</hi> with thoſe ſtones any more, though they ſhould be at the charge of burning fifty times as much Wood as is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and this, becauſe in that interval of heat the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>ſtone,</hi> which were begun to be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55119:42"/>opened, do <hi>cloſe</hi> and ſhut, and the matter ſinks down in a lump to the deſtruction of the whole. And then again the <hi>Flame</hi> can't riſe in it any more, for it finds none of thoſe <hi>interſtices,</hi> or ſpaces between, which were frequent before, for it to paſs through. The matter therefore is rendred uncapable of receiving the fire any more, becauſe all the ſmall cells that were uſeful for it, are ſhut up and deſtroyed in this confuſion.</p>
               <p>'Tis Objected, that if <hi>igneous bodies</hi> were they that cauſed the <hi>Corroſion</hi> of <hi>Quick-lime, Tiles, Bricks,</hi> and all <hi>Stones</hi> that are not of the nature of <hi>Lime-ſtone,</hi> and <hi>Iron, Copper, Silver, Gold,</hi> and many other bodies ſhould be as Cauſtick as <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> after having endured the fire as long if not longer than it.</p>
               <p>But this does not follow, for <hi>Tiles,</hi> and other <hi>Calcined ſtones</hi> have not the <hi>Pores</hi> diſpoſed like thoſe of <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> to retain fiery particles; and if ſome <hi>metals</hi> are found to impregnate with them during their <hi>Calcination,</hi> they are known to retain them ſo well by the ſolidity of their parts, that neither the heat nor moiſture of the fleſh are able to draw them out of the places they are fixt in, to cauſe a <hi>Corroſion</hi> upon the part. It is eaſie here to give you an example; for if you take the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> that encreaſed its weight in the <hi>Calcination,</hi> as I have ſaid before, and ſteep it in <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>water</hi> will not act at all upon it, and the <hi>Calx</hi> may be taken from the water in the ſame weight it was put in; you muſt melt it by fire, if you would ſeparate the igneous bodies: but now as for common

                  <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> a ſmall matter of moiſture is able to ſeparate the tender parts of the <hi>ſtone,</hi> and drive out the fiery particles in abundance.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid likewiſe that the boiling of the water which happens when flung upon <hi>quick-lime,</hi> muſt not be imputed to fiery bodies, ſeeing neither <hi>ſpirit of Wine,</hi> nor <hi>Oyl,</hi> when thrown upon it, do hear or ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I <hi>Anſwer</hi> that theſe effects do proceed from this, that <hi>Oyl, ſpirit of wine,</hi> and other <hi>Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous</hi> liquors of the ſame nature, inſtead of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the parts of <hi>quick lime,</hi> as <hi>water</hi> does, do rather hinder any ſeparation from being made, by ſtopping up the Pores.</p>
               <p>That which withdrew me from the Sentiment of thoſe who will have all the effects of <hi>quick-lime</hi> derived from its <hi>ſalt,</hi> was, that I could never find any of it, though I ſought after it with care enough, for ſome through a miſtake do take a certain <hi>Bituminous ſcum,</hi> which often ſwims upon the <hi>Lime-water,</hi> for a <hi>Salt.</hi>

                     <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> is here mixt that the <hi>Volatile</hi> parts may carry off the more ſoluble portion of the <hi>ſtone Haematites;</hi> for it would never be able to <hi>ſublime,</hi> if it were not driven by ſome ſuch like Vehicle.

                  <p>The <hi>Cucurbite</hi> is ſet in an open fire, that it may be heated the more, and the <hi>Flowers</hi> be the more tinctur'd; for the more heat there is, the <hi>ſal armoniack</hi> does the more eaſily <hi>ſublime</hi> the parts of the <hi>ſtone;</hi> the <hi>Volatile ſpirit</hi> is only ſome portion of the <hi>Flowers</hi> drawn into liquor.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>maſs</hi> that remains in the <hi>Cucurbite</hi> is a mixture of the more <hi>fixt</hi> part of the <hi>ſtone,</hi> and <hi>ſal armoniack.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that is drawn from the <hi>ſtone Haematites</hi> is accounted of ſome uſe, and chiefly ſo by reaſon of the <hi>Iron</hi> it contains.</p>
                  <p>Many other <hi>Preparations</hi> of this <hi>ſtone</hi> have been invented, but theſe are the beſt, and choiceſt.</p>

                  <hi>Sea ſalt</hi> is made at <hi>Rochell</hi> in <hi>ſalt marſhes,</hi> which are places that muſt be of a lower ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the <hi>ſea,</hi> and the ground muſt be Clayie, for otherwiſe they would not be able to retain the <hi>ſalt-water</hi> that has been let into them. Thus all places near the <hi>ſea</hi> are not alike proper to make <hi>ſalt marſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Seaſon of the year begins to grow hot, which commonly happens in <hi>May,</hi> all the water is emptied that was put into the <hi>marſhes</hi> for better preſerving them during the Winter, then the <hi>ſluces</hi> are opened to let in as much <hi>ſalt-water</hi> as they think fit, 'tis made to paſs through a great many <hi>Channels,</hi> wherein it <hi>purifies</hi> and <hi>heats,</hi> and then is let into places that are made flat, ſmooth and fit to <hi>Cryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>ſalt</hi> is made only during the great <hi>heats</hi> of <hi>Summer,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> does in the firſt place evaporate ſome part of the <hi>Water,</hi> and becauſe after the great
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55119:45"/>heat, a ſmall <hi>Wind</hi> does uſe to blow (as is uſual near the <hi>ſea</hi>) the <hi>coolneſs</hi> of this <hi>Wind</hi> does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe and <hi>Cryſtallize</hi> the <hi>ſalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it happens to <hi>rain</hi> but two hours during the hot weather, there can no <hi>ſalt</hi> be made for a fortnight afterwards, becauſe the <hi>marſhes</hi> muſt be again emptied of all the <hi>water,</hi> to let in more in its place, ſo that if it chances to <hi>rain</hi> but once again in the next fortnight, they can make no <hi>ſalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the <hi>Purification</hi> of <hi>ſalt</hi> by <hi>evaporation,</hi> it may be further <hi>purified,</hi> if inſtead of <hi>Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the humidity, you ſet ſome of it a <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallizing</hi> in a cool place, for very fine <hi>pure ſalt</hi> is found at bottom of the veſſel, which <hi>ſalt</hi> may be ſeparated from the water, and dried, you may then evaporate again ſome part of the <hi>ſalt</hi> liquor, and ſet it in a Celler a <hi>Cryſtallizing,</hi> and ſo continue your <hi>Evaporations</hi> and <hi>Cryſtalliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> but at laſt you muſt be fain to evaporate the liquor to the conſumption of all the humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe at laſt it will <hi>Cryſtallize</hi> no longer, the reaſon whereof is, that the remaining <hi>ſalt</hi> is full of a fat bituminous matter, which is in a manner inſeparable from it, and this 'tis that hinders the <hi>Cryſtallizing</hi> at laſt.</p>
               <p>'Tis probable that this fat matter comes from the earth of thoſe <hi>marſhes</hi> that were ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Cryſtallized ſalt</hi> being put into <hi>Oyl of Tantar,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> diſſolved, does mix with it without making any <hi>Ebullition,</hi> becauſe although <hi>ſea-ſalt</hi> is <hi>Acid,</hi> yet its points are too groſs, and have too little motion, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the parts of the <hi>Alkali.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The laſt <hi>ſalt</hi> being dried over the fire, and mixed with ſome <hi>Alkali ſalt rendred liquid,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Oyl of Tartar,</hi> makes a <hi>Coagulation</hi> and <hi>Precipitation</hi> of a ſubſtance that appears <hi>ſaline</hi> and <hi>Oyly;</hi> this <hi>Coagulation</hi> does proceed from the mixture and adheſion of <hi>Bituminous</hi> earth with <hi>ſea-ſalt</hi> and <hi>Tartar;</hi> for theſe <hi>ſalts</hi> do eaſily embrace <hi>Oyly</hi> ſubſtances, and in them loſe their activity.</p>
               <p>Many <hi>Acid Bituminous ſalts</hi> which are drawn by the <hi>Evaporation</hi> of certain <hi>Mineral waters,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Baleruc</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Digne</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> do perform the ſame effects, when they are mixed with <hi>Oyl of Tartar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Coagulum</hi> does not diſſolve in water, as well by reaſon of the different nature of the <hi>ſalts</hi> it is compounded of, as the <hi>Oyly</hi> earth that holds them together; but it will diſſolve in <hi>diſtilled Vinegar,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Acid</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and then an <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> riſes, becauſe the <hi>Acid</hi> does penetrate the <hi>ſalt of Tartar,</hi> whoſe parts <hi>ſea-ſalt</hi> had no power to ſeparate.</p>

               <p>Since I writ of <hi>Monſieur Seignett's</hi> particular way of drawing <hi>ſpirit of ſalt,</hi> ſome have Printed, that if common <hi>ſalt</hi> well <hi>decrepitated,</hi> and kept a good while over the fire, were expoſed to the <hi>Air</hi> for ſome daies, and <hi>diſtilled</hi> without <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of any thing to it, it would yield a <hi>ſpirit</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:55119:46"/>much like that I have ſpoken of, and in full as great a quantity.</p>
               <p>But if we examine the ſharp liquor which is drawn this way, we ſhall find it of ſo weak a nature, that it may more reaſonably be called <hi>Phlegm,</hi> than <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>ſalt</hi> remains entire in the <hi>Retort;</hi> whereas M. <hi>Seignett's ſpirit of ſalt</hi> is full as ſtrong as common <hi>ſpirit of ſalt,</hi> &amp; has the very ſame quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nay I conceive it ſomewhat better, as not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great an <hi>Impreſſion</hi> from <hi>fire</hi> as the other.</p>
               <p>Again ſome ſay, it does not deſerve the name of <hi>ſpirit of ſea-ſalt,</hi> nor ought this <hi>Preparation</hi> to be look'd upon as any great <hi>myſtery,</hi> becauſe the ſame incorporation and augmentation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to divers other <hi>ſalts</hi> expoſed to the <hi>Air,</hi> after drawing off their <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant this <hi>augmentation</hi> proceeds from the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>air,</hi> and I conceive it is the ſame <hi>ſpirit</hi> which produces all manner of things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Matrixes</hi> or different pores of the earth it uſes to meet with, as I have explicated in my <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Principles.</hi> But becauſe this <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>air</hi> has met with <hi>Pores</hi> in our matter, ready diſpoſed to make a <hi>ſalt</hi> much like unto common <hi>ſalt,</hi> and a <hi>ſpirit</hi> is drawn from it much like unto that which is drawn from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>ſalt,</hi> I ſee no reaſon to doubt why this <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> ſhould not be a true <hi>ſpirit of ſalt;</hi> all the difference is this, the <hi>ſalt</hi> I now ſpeak of is not ſo throughly united to its earthy part, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>ſalt</hi> is, and therefore its <hi>ſpirits</hi> do ſeparate with more eaſe; for they are drawn without <hi>Addition</hi> of any thing elſe, and with a gentle
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55119:46"/>fire, whereas thoſe of common <hi>ſalt</hi> are ſo fixt, that they can't be driven out, without mixing a great deal of <hi>earth</hi> in order to ſeparate all its parts, and without a very great fire.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Augmentation</hi> which happens to many other bodies expoſed to the Air, after their <hi>ſpirits</hi> are drawn off, I don't queſtion the matter of fact, nor that theſe ſame ſubſtances do return into what they were before, by impregnating again with <hi>ſpirits</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> in conſiderable time; but it is rarely found that any of them do yield as ſtrong <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and as eaſily as our <hi>ſalt,</hi> and herein lies the <hi>myſtery.</hi>

               <p>Some have written, that the <hi>Precipitation,</hi> which is made by <hi>ſpirit of ſalt,</hi> of any matter held up by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> muſt not be imputed to the gravity, nor force of <hi>ſpirit of ſalt,</hi> nor to any conflict or jogg that this <hi>ſpirit</hi> gives to <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or the matters diſſolved; but rather to the conjunction of the <hi>Acidity</hi> of this <hi>ſpirit</hi> with the <hi>Volatile</hi> and <hi>Sulphureous Alkali</hi> of <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> or <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Niter,</hi> which <hi>Acid</hi> hereby forces this laſt to abandon the <hi>metal</hi> it had diſſolved.</p>

               <p>The great and violent <hi>flame</hi> which happens as ſoon as <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is flung upon the <hi>Coals,</hi> and the <hi>red vapours</hi> which it uſes to yield when reduced into a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> have induced the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> generally to believe that this <hi>ſalt</hi> is <hi>inflammable,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently full loaded with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> is the only <hi>Principle</hi> that <hi>flames;</hi> but if they had ſuſpended their judgments herein, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had got more experience on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they would not only have known that <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is not at all <hi>Inflammable</hi> by nature, but they would e'en have doubted whether or no any <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> does enter into the <hi>natural compoſition</hi> of this <hi>ſalt;</hi> for if <hi>Salt-peter</hi> were <hi>Inflammable</hi> of it ſelf like <hi>ſulphur,</hi> it would <hi>burn</hi> in places where there is no <hi>ſulphur,</hi> for example in a <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:55119:47"/>heated red hot in the fire; but it will never <hi>flame</hi> therein, uſe what quantity of it you pleaſe, and let the fire be never ſo great. It is true indeed, if you throw <hi>Salt-peter</hi> upon <hi>kindled coals,</hi> it makes a great <hi>flame,</hi> but this is only through the <hi>Sulphureous Fuliginoſities</hi> of the <hi>coals,</hi> which are violently raiſed and rarified by the <hi>Volatile</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Niter;</hi> as I ſhall prove in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>fixt Niter.</hi>

                  <p>This Operation has much reſemblance with that which happens when <hi>Oyl of Turpentine</hi> is put into a bottle with <hi>Oyl of Vitriol;</hi> for the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe liquors does <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>boil</hi> much alike. I ſhall ſay ſomething of this laſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hereafter. There is this difference notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that <hi>spirit of Niter</hi> being more <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> than <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> cauſes a greater <hi>Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order therefore to explicate this <hi>Ebullition,</hi> two things muſt be conſidered. Firſt, that <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Niter</hi> contains a great many fiery parts lock't up in its <hi>Acidity,</hi> but which ſtill retain ſome motion, for 'tis they that make <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> to <hi>Fume</hi> as it does.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, that <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> is more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable</hi> than <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> when mixed with any <hi>ſulphureous</hi> body, and the reaſon thereof is, that it is more <hi>rarified</hi> than <hi>ſalt-peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus when this <hi>Acid spirit</hi> is mixt with <hi>spirit of Wine,</hi> which is a <hi>ſulphur</hi> very much <hi>exalted,</hi> and very ſuſceptible of motion, the <hi>Volatile</hi> part
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55119:49"/>of the <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> joyns its ſelf to this <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and the mixture becomes ready to take <hi>flame;</hi> likewiſe after this mixture the fiery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were in <hi>Spirit of Niter,</hi> do by ſtriving to mount upwards put the liquor into ſo great a motion, that it e'en almoſt <hi>flames,</hi> and would without all queſtion quite <hi>flame,</hi> if there were not ſome <hi>Phlegm</hi> always mixed with theſe <hi>ſpirits,</hi> let 'em be drawn never ſo <hi>pure,</hi> which ſerves to allay the activity of the fiery particles; ſo that there muſt needs follow a very great <hi>Ebullition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> therefore proceeds from this, that <hi>ſpirit of wine,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit of Niter,</hi> which are as it were a <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> and highly <hi>exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſulphur,</hi> have been almoſt kindled into a <hi>flame</hi> by the fiery bodies that were in <hi>ſpirit of Niter;</hi> and that which further proves this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is, a <hi>noiſe</hi> or kind of <hi>Detonation,</hi> during the <hi>Efferveſcency,</hi> which is much like that which happens, when <hi>ſulphur</hi> and <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> are burnt together.</p>
                  <p>The great <hi>diminution</hi> of the liquor proceeds from the <hi>Evaporation</hi> of the more <hi>Volatile</hi> parts of the <hi>Spirits of wine</hi> and <hi>Niter,</hi> through the neck of the <hi>Boulthead</hi> during the <hi>Ebullition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which remains is a well <hi>ſweetned ſpirit of Niter,</hi> for not only its points are ſoundly blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Ebullition,</hi> but the <hi>ſpirit of wine</hi> being a <hi>ſulphur</hi> unites and imbodies with thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, ſo that they have no longer any <hi>Corroſive</hi> quality.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Detonation</hi> is more violent than that which is made with a mixture of <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> and common <hi>ſulphur,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſulphur</hi> of <hi>Coals</hi> is more <hi>Rarified</hi> than common <hi>ſulphur.</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55119:50"/>loaded with <hi>fuliginous</hi> or <hi>Oyly</hi> parts, do ſend forth but only a <hi>ſmall blew flame;</hi> but when theſe two bodies come to be mixt together, the <hi>Volatile</hi> parts of <hi>Niter</hi> joyning with the <hi>Coals,</hi> which are <hi>Oyly,</hi> do rarify and <hi>exalt</hi> the <hi>Coals</hi> with ſuch a violence, that they produce a very great <hi>flame.</hi> Now this Operation confirms my Opinion that <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> does only ſerve here to <hi>Rarifie</hi> the <hi>flame</hi> of <hi>ſulphur,</hi> but cannot ſend forth the leaſt <hi>flame</hi> of its ſelf; ſeeing that as ſoon as ever the <hi>coals,</hi> you put into the <hi>Crucible,</hi> are <hi>burnt,</hi> the <hi>flame</hi> goes out, and appears no more until you throw in more <hi>Coals,</hi> with which a convenient proportion of the <hi>Volatile</hi> parts of <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> that ſtill remained, does joyn, and <hi>Rarifie</hi> them into a <hi>flame.</hi> Thus new <hi>Coals</hi> are ſucceſſively thrown into the <hi>Crucible,</hi> until it <hi>flames</hi> no longer; but toward the end of the Operation, becauſe there remain but few <hi>Volatile</hi> parts of <hi>Niter,</hi> the <hi>Detonation</hi> is much the leſs, and ſo is the <hi>flame,</hi> until at laſt the <hi>Coals</hi> finding nothing more in <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> for it to raiſe, do burn only juſt as they uſe to do all alone.</p>
               <p>If you make uſe of common <hi>ſalt-peter</hi> for this <hi>Operation,</hi> you'l have occaſion to uſe but three ounces and a half of <hi>Coals,</hi> and you'l get twelve ounces of <hi>Purified ſalt,</hi> but if you uſe <hi>fine ſalt-peter,</hi> you muſt ſpend ſeven ounces of <hi>Coals,</hi> and will get but three ounces of <hi>purified ſalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This difference of weight proceeds from the <hi>fine ſalt-peters</hi> containing more <hi>Volatile</hi> parts than the other; likewiſe a great deal more <hi>Coals</hi> is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe them, and there remains the leſs <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> for the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55119:51"/>
               <p>The <hi>fixt Niter</hi> being prepared as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is a little grey colour'd; now to make it <hi>white</hi> you muſt <hi>Calcine</hi> it in a great fire, ſtirring it in the <hi>Crucible</hi> all the while with a <hi>ſpatule;</hi> when it ſhall have continued <hi>Red hot</hi> for above an hour, it will become exceeding <hi>white.</hi> You muſt then <hi>diſſolve</hi> it in water, <hi>filter</hi> the diſſolution, and <hi>evaporate</hi> the water, and thus you have a very <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>white ſalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>ſalt</hi> is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> being a mixture of the <hi>ſalt of Coals,</hi> which is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and <hi>fixt ſalt-peter;</hi> theſe two <hi>ſalts</hi> are ſo ſtrictly united and mixed together in the <hi>Calcination,</hi> that they make a <hi>Porous ſalt,</hi> and ſuch as is much like unto the <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that there is an <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> in <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> as <hi>Chymiſts</hi> will have it; for give what <hi>Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or other <hi>Preparation</hi> you pleaſe to this <hi>Mineral ſalt,</hi> without adding any thing to it, not the leaſt <hi>Alkali</hi> can be drawn from it, and all that ever we can ſee in it is <hi>Acid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is further <hi>Obſervable,</hi> that the <hi>liquor</hi> of <hi>fixt Niter,</hi> which has been made with common <hi>ſalt-peter,</hi> being kept a year, or a year and a half, loſes moſt of its activity as an <hi>Alkali,</hi> ſo that it is no longer able to cauſe any ſuch <hi>Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with <hi>Acids,</hi> as it could before it was ſo ſtale.</p>
               <p>This accident can have no other cauſe, than that the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>ſalt</hi> contained in the <hi>liquor</hi> do cloſe up by little and little, and the <hi>Acid ſalt of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> does abſorbe and deſtroy the <hi>Alkali,</hi> which kept the <hi>Pores</hi> open.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:55119:51"/>
               <p>But the ſame thing does not happen, where the <hi>liquor</hi> of <hi>fixt Niter</hi> was made with <hi>Purified ſalt-peter,</hi> becauſe whereas a great deal of <hi>Coals</hi> was uſed in the <hi>fixing</hi> it, and but little <hi>ſalt of Niter</hi> remained in it, the <hi>Alkali</hi> muſt there predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſo powerfully, that the <hi>Acid</hi> is not able to regain its ſtrength.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Experiment</hi> ſeems plainly to demonſtrate, that <hi>fixt Niter</hi> is only an <hi>Acid ſalt</hi> rendred <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> by the <hi>Alkali</hi> of <hi>Coals.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>It is <hi>Objected,</hi> that if there is any heavy matter as it were intercepted between the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> it muſt needs <hi>Precipitate</hi> of its ſelf, after the action of <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> upon this <hi>metal,</hi> which is a thing that does not happen.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer</hi> that if the parts of <hi>Gold</hi> are heavy, the <hi>Diſſolvent</hi> is a groſs body, and very well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to hold up thoſe heavy parts, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from <hi>Precipitating.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others have oppoſed this Explication, and have writ, that if <hi>Aqua Regalis</hi> diſſolves <hi>Gold,</hi> and can't diſſolve <hi>Sylver,</hi> the reaſon of it is, that the groſs points of <hi>spirit of Niter,</hi> or <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> are <hi>ſubtilized</hi> by the mixture of <hi>ſal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> and are rendred fit to enter into the <hi>ſmall pores</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> whereas the delicate Fabrick of theſe ſame points does not leave the neceſſary force nor motion to divide the parts of <hi>Sylver,</hi> whoſe <hi>pores</hi> are a great deal <hi>bigger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this way of arguing does not agree with <hi>Experience;</hi> for what likelihood is there that the points of <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> are ſo <hi>ſubtilized</hi> by the penetration and diviſion of the parts of <hi>ſal Armoniack?</hi> or where ſhall we find any Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that after a conſiderable <hi>Efferveſcency</hi> of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55119:52"/>two <hi>ſalts</hi> met together in conflict, the <hi>Acidity</hi> grows ſharper than it was before? this is a thing that can never be proved. On the contrary, every body knows well enough that no <hi>Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> happens but the <hi>acid</hi> is partly blunted or broken thereby. Moreover the Argument ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> does break its ſubtileſt points in violently contending with the <hi>ſal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> whereas in <hi>ſal armoniack</hi> there are <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali ſalts</hi> whoſe property it is to deſtroy <hi>acids.</hi> I could further add here, that the conjunction of <hi>ſalt</hi> with <hi>ſpirit of Niter</hi> ſhould of neceſſity ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its points more groſs than they were, and that the <hi>Cryſtals</hi> which are drawn by the uſe of <hi>aqua Regalis</hi> have their ſhape not ſo ſharp as thoſe that are drawn by <hi>aqua Fortis.</hi> But that which I have ſaid is ſo probable in its ſelf, and ſo eaſie to be convinced of, if one takes never ſo little pains to conſider it, that I ſhould but amuſe the Reader to little purpoſe, if I ſhould offer to give any more proofs of it.</p>
               <p>Neither do I find it convenient to make a long diſcourſe in Explicating how <hi>Sylver,</hi> which has <hi>leſſer Pores,</hi> is more ſuſceptible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Air and Fire, than <hi>Gold</hi> which has <hi>larger,</hi> ſeeing I have already ſuppoſed that the <hi>matter intercepted</hi> between the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> is more <hi>compact,</hi> and conſequently more <hi>hard to ſeparate</hi> than that of <hi>Sylver.</hi>

               <p>You ſee by this Operation that eight ounces of <hi>Sal armoniack</hi> do contain at leaſt four ounces and a half of <hi>Volatile ſalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Volatile Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sal armoniack</hi> is only a diſſolution of <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> in <hi>water,</hi> and if there is not <hi>Phlegm</hi> ſufficient to diſſolve all the <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalt,</hi> there remains ſome part of it at bottom of the <hi>Receiver,</hi> and that may likewiſe be turn'd into <hi>Spirit,</hi> by only adding enough <hi>water</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it.

               <p>This <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Sudorifick,</hi> but you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more ſenſibly the effect of <hi>Sal armoniack</hi> to cauſe <hi>Sweat,</hi> by diſſolving ſix or eight grains of this <hi>Salt,</hi> and the ſame quantity of <hi>Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> each ſeparately in two ſmall Doſes of ſome proper liquor, and giving them to a Patient one preſently after the other; for the <hi>ſalt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> working upon the <hi>Sal armoniack</hi> in the <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi>

               <p>If you diſſolve a little <hi>white,</hi> or <hi>green Vitriol</hi> in water, and <hi>write</hi> with the <hi>Diſſolution,</hi> the <hi>writing</hi> will not be ſeen, but if you rub the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with a little Cotton dipt in the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Galls,</hi> it will appear legible; then if you wet a little more Cotton in <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> and paſs it gently over the Paper, the <hi>Ink</hi> will <hi>diſappear</hi> again; and yet at laſt if you rub the place with a little more Cotton dipt in <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> made <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> it will again appear legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but of a Yellowiſh colour.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that I can give for theſe Effects is this, the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> diſſolves a certain <hi>Coagulum</hi> which is made of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Galls,</hi> but the <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> breaking the force of this <hi>Acid Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Coagulum</hi> reſumes it ſelf, and appears again, but becauſe it now contains <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> too, it acquires a new colour.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould throw the diſſolution of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Vitriol</hi> only powder'd into a ſtrong <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>dried Roſes,</hi> it will turn as black as common Ink; if you pour ſome drops of <hi>ſpirit of Vitriol</hi> into it, this <hi>Ink</hi> will turn <hi>red;</hi> and if you add to it a little <hi>Volatile ſpirit of Sal Armoniack,</hi> 'twill turn <hi>grey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe changes of colour do proceed from the <hi>ſpirit of Vitriols</hi> diſſolving the <hi>Coagulum</hi> which the <hi>Vitriol</hi> it ſelf had made, and rendring it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55119:54"/>
                  <hi>inviſible;</hi> the liquor recovers a freſher <hi>Red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> than it had, before the <hi>Vitriol</hi> was put into it, becauſe the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> does ſeparate the parts of the <hi>Roſe</hi> which were diſſolved in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and renders them more <hi>Viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Volatile ſpirit of Sal Armoniack,</hi> which is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> does partly break the <hi>Acid</hi> edges of the <hi>ſpirit of Vitriol,</hi> ſo that the parts of the <hi>Roſe</hi> having nothing more to hold them <hi>Rarified,</hi> do cloſe together, and conſequently the liquor changes colour.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Experiment</hi> may be ſeen, that the <hi>dried Roſe</hi> may ſerve to make <hi>Ink</hi> with, as well as <hi>Galls; Indian</hi> Wood, and divers other things will do the ſame.</p>

               <p>If one ſhould reſolve to dry as exactly as one can, ſixteen pounds of <hi>green Vitriol,</hi> there would remain but ſeven pounds of <hi>white Vitriol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in order to do this exactly, you muſt powder the <hi>white Maſs</hi> of <hi>Calcined Vitriol,</hi> after you have broke the <hi>Pot,</hi> and ſtir it for a long time in an Earthen <hi>Pan,</hi> over a little fire, until there riſes no more <hi>Fume</hi> from it, or until there remains in it no more <hi>Phlegm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſhould <hi>Calcine</hi> this <hi>white Vitriol</hi> to a <hi>Redneſs,</hi> you'd have five pounds and a half of <hi>Cholcothar.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:55119:55"/>
               <p>Some have affirmed in writing that the <hi>Red colour</hi> which appears after a long <hi>Calcination</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Vitriol,</hi> was an undoubted proof that that there was <hi>Copper</hi> in it, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Red colour</hi> which happens to <hi>Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe calcined</hi> is a certain proof that it contains in it ſome particles of <hi>Copper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which is here ſaid to paſs for a thing undeniable, is no proof at all; for firſt of all thoſe <hi>Vitriols</hi> which are thought moſt to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of <hi>Copper,</hi> do give no greater <hi>Redneſs</hi> in their <hi>Calcination,</hi> that the others which partake leaſt of it. Secondly let <hi>Copper</hi> be <hi>Prepared</hi> which way you pleaſe, you can never make it <hi>Redder</hi> than the <hi>Cholcothar</hi> of. <hi>Engliſh Vitriol,</hi> whoſe <hi>Redneſs</hi> muſt be thought to proceed from ſome particles of this <hi>Metal</hi> contained in it. And thirdly, we ſee plainly, that <hi>Iron, Lead, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and divers <hi>Mineral</hi> bodies do acquire a <hi>Red colour</hi> in their <hi>Calcining,</hi> without granting they contain any <hi>Copper.</hi>

               <p>If you Diſtil eight pounds of <hi>white Vitriol,</hi> at ſixteen ounces to the pound, you'l draw off ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen ounces of <hi>Phlegm,</hi> and two and twenty ounces and a half, both of the <hi>Sulphureous,</hi> and the <hi>Acid ſpirit of Vitriol.</hi> Of theſe two and twenty ounces and a half, there will be five ounces of <hi>Sulphureous ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:55119:55"/>
               <p>You'l find in the <hi>Retort</hi> five pounds, five oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Cholcothar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Uſe all the care you can poſſible to preſerve all the liquors which come from <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and yet it will be impoſſible for you to hinder it from loſing ſome through the <hi>Junctures,</hi> during the <hi>Diſtillation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſhould uſe <hi>German</hi> inſtead of <hi>Engliſh Vitriol,</hi> you'd draw off a little more <hi>ſpirit</hi> than the quantity I named, but it would have ſome ſmell of <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and the matter which remains in the <hi>Retort</hi> would be of a <hi>brown</hi> colour drawing towards <hi>black.</hi> This Colour proceeds from <hi>ſulphureous Fuliginoſities</hi> which riſe more from this <hi>Vitriol</hi> than the other, becauſe it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of <hi>Copper;</hi> for this Sooty vapour finding no vent to get out at, falls down again upon the matter and blackens it.</p>
               <p>There's one thing happens about the <hi>Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> when 'tis very ſtrong, which is very ſtrange indeed; it is, that if you mix it with its <hi>Acid Spirit,</hi> or with <hi>water,</hi> or elſe with an <hi>Ethereal Oyl,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Oyl of Turpentine,</hi> this mixture grows <hi>hot</hi> to that degree, that ſometimes it breaks the <hi>Viol</hi> 'twas put into, and often it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a conſiderable <hi>Ebullition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould quickly give account of this <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>Ebullition,</hi> if I would ſuppoſe an <hi>Alkali</hi> in the <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> as thoſe do who pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate every thing that happens by the notions of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali;</hi> but not comprehending how an <hi>Alkali</hi> ſhould be able to remain ſo long a time with ſo ſtrong an <hi>Acid</hi> as is the <hi>Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55119:56"/>without being deſtroyed, I had rather give a reaſon that ſeems to me abundance more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
               <p>I conveive therefore that if <hi>water,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> or the <hi>Ethereal Oyl of Turpentine</hi> do <hi>heat</hi> the <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> it is by ſetting in motion a great many <hi>fiery particles</hi> which the <hi>Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> had drawn with it in the <hi>Diſtillation;</hi> for theſe little fiery bodies being environ'd with <hi>ſalts</hi> that are exceeding heavy, and hard to <hi>Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi> they drive about vehemently whatſoever ſtands in their way, and when they have cauſed an <hi>Ebullition,</hi> and find they can't get out a-top of the <hi>Viol,</hi> they break it to pieces with the buſſle they make at bottom, and on the ſides.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it will-be ſaid, I do here ſuppoſe <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> that the <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> does contain <hi>fiery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> but if we conſider the great violence of fire, and the time that is ſpent in drawing this <hi>Acid,</hi> 'twill be no ſuch hard matter to grant me this ſuppoſition. Beſides it will be hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the great and burning <hi>Corroſion</hi> of <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> without admitting theſe <hi>fiery</hi> parts, for the <hi>Vitriol</hi> contains nothing in it ſelf of this <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi> nature; 'tis true indeed that it contains <hi>Phlegm, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> but it is a thing impoſſible but this <hi>Acid</hi> ſhould diſcover it ſelf more than it does, if it were as <hi>Corroſive</hi> in the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Oyl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once it hapned to me, that putting into my <hi>Furnace</hi> a <hi>Retort</hi> whoſe two thirds were filled with <hi>German Vitriol</hi> dried, in order to draw off its <hi>Spirits,</hi> I <hi>Diſtilled</hi> firſt of all the <hi>Phlegm,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55119:56"/>and <hi>ſulphureous ſpirit,</hi> which I took out of the <hi>Receiver;</hi> I then fitted it again to the <hi>Retort,</hi> and by a great fire continued for three dayes and three nights, I <hi>diſtilled</hi> off the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> as we are uſed to do. When the Veſſels were grown cold, I admired to find in my <hi>Receiver</hi> nothing but a <hi>Maſs</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Congeal'd Oyl of Vitriol:</hi> This <hi>Salt</hi> was ſo exceeding <hi>Cauſtick</hi> and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if I offer'd to touch the ſmalleſt part of it with my finger, I preſently felt an inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>ſcalding,</hi> and was fain to put my hand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into <hi>water,</hi> it continued to fume ſtill, and when a little of it was thrown into <hi>water,</hi> it made the ſame hiſſing noiſe, as a fire-coal put into <hi>water</hi> would do. Beſides it <hi>heated</hi> the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> very much, and much more than common <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> could.</p>
               <p>If you fill a Glaſs Viol with the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Nephritick Wood</hi> clarified, and obſerve it, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the Light, it will appear <hi>Yellow;</hi> but if you turn your back to the Light, it will appear <hi>Blew;</hi> if you mix with it ſome dregs of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will appear <hi>Yellow</hi> on every ſide, but if you again and about as much more <hi>Oyl of Tartar,</hi> it will return unto its <hi>firſt</hi> colour.</p>
               <p>If you take a <hi>Blew,</hi> or <hi>Violet tincture</hi> made in <hi>water,</hi> ſuch as is drawn out of the <hi>Sun-Flower,</hi> or <hi>Violet Flowers,</hi> and pour upon it ſome drops of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will preſently turn <hi>Red;</hi> but if you throw into it ſome <hi>Alkali ſalt,</hi> it will recover again its former colour.</p>
               <p>On the contrary if you pour an <hi>Alkali</hi> liquor, ſuch as <hi>Volatile Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> upon
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55119:57"/>the <hi>Blew tincture,</hi> it will preſently turn <hi>Green;</hi> and if you again pour upon it a little <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will change this colour into an obſcure <hi>Red.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Indian Wood</hi> is very <hi>Red:</hi> if you drop into it a little <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> it will turn <hi>Yellow;</hi> and if you ſtill add ſome <hi>Volatile Spirit of Sal Armoniack</hi> it will become <hi>black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe changes of colour, which the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> or other <hi>Acids,</hi> and <hi>Alkali's</hi> do make, proceed only from the different poſition of bodies diſſolved in the liquor, and from its diſpoſition to <hi>modifie</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> different wayes.</p>

               <p>But when I aſſerted that the <hi>Spirits</hi> of divers <hi>Wines</hi> are extreamly much loaded with <hi>Tartar,</hi> I did not mean that <hi>Tartar</hi> which <hi>Petrifies</hi> at the ſides of the veſſels, for that ſame is quiet, and does not hinder the <hi>Exaltation</hi> of <hi>Spirits;</hi> but I intended a <hi>Tartar</hi> that ſtill remains mixt in the <hi>Wine</hi> after the <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it abounds more or leſs, does render the <hi>Wines</hi> more or leſs thick and groſs.

               <p>Divers little <hi>Objections</hi> have been made me on this ſubject, for want of duly examining what I have eſtabliſhed.

               <p>Some perſons do endeavour to reject the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> that I have deſcribed for drawing <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> becauſe, ſay they, a long time is required to draw a little <hi>Spirit,</hi> and by reaſon of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty they conceive in procuring ſuch Veſſels well made, at <hi>Paris,</hi> and much more ſo in the <hi>Countrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is likely theſe Gentlemen do blame this <hi>Method,</hi> before ever they tried it; for if they had but taken the pains to make the <hi>Experiment</hi> of it, they would have found that with two or three of theſe Veſſels, they might have drawn as much <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> as they could be able to do with their great <hi>Machine;</hi> and that this <hi>Spirit</hi> is not liable to the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> which might be communicated to it from <hi>Copper</hi> or <hi>Tin</hi> veſſels.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55119:61"/>As for the difficulty that there is pretended of finding theſe <hi>Glaſs</hi> veſſels, there is none at all that I know of, but only for ſuch as will not take the pains to <hi>viſit</hi> the <hi>Glaſs-houſes,</hi> for there they would find enough for their turn; and though I uſe a great many of them in my <hi>Courſes of Chymiſtry,</hi> I never was to ſeek for any yet.

               <p>A ſign, that the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> has carried along with it ſome of the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> is this: if you <hi>dry</hi> gently the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> that remains in the <hi>Cucurbite,</hi> and weigh it, you'l find it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed an ounce and a half.</p>

               <p>This way of <hi>Tartarizing Spirit of Wine</hi> is the very beſt and ſhorteſt of all that have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, whether you deſire to make it <hi>Pure,</hi> or to <hi>impregnate</hi> it with <hi>ſalt of Tartar;</hi> and I may venture to ſay, that all the many long and tedious deſcriptions that have been given of this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have been only invented to caſt a duſt into the eyes of <hi>Novices;</hi> for it is eaſie for any to obſerve, who give themſelves a little to examine things, that after all their long turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and circumſtances to no purpoſe, the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is not ſo well <hi>Tartarized,</hi> as by the plain Method that I have deſcribed.</p>

               <p>Some endeavouring to <hi>Criticize</hi> to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, do ſay, it is altogether uſeleſs to <hi>digeſt

               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>Circumſtance</hi> is very <hi>neceſſary,</hi> if we deſire to have a <hi>Water</hi> well <hi>impregnated</hi> with the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Flowers,</hi> for although there is a <hi>Volatile</hi> ſubſtance in <hi>Roſemary,</hi> yet good part of the <hi>Oyl,</hi> in which conſiſts principally the <hi>Smell,</hi> is involved in the other <hi>Principles,</hi> and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well <hi>Rarified,</hi> mixed, and <hi>Exalted,</hi> but only by a <hi>Digeſtion:</hi> and thus we find a very good <hi>Effect</hi> from it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But we muſt conſider that <hi>Wine,</hi> let it be as clear and pure as may be, does always retain the more <hi>ſalt</hi> and <hi>ſubtile</hi> part of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which exalts and eaſily ſmells, when by the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> it gets the predominancy of the <hi>Sulphureous Spirits,</hi> which held it as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved: and thus clear <hi>wine</hi> ſowrs when alone, but it does not ſowr ſo faſt, and the <hi>Vinegar</hi> is not ſo ſtrong, as when it is made upon <hi>Tartar.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It may be added here, that the <hi>Air</hi> to which <hi>Wines</hi> are expoſed, by leaving the veſſel open, when they would have them turn into Vinegar, does likewiſe communicate a little of its <hi>Acidity</hi> to the <hi>Wines,</hi> in the ſtirring up, and rarifying the <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Tartar.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>I commonly uſe to draw this way four ounces of very <hi>white,</hi> and well <hi>Purified ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> from each pound of <hi>Red Tartar;</hi> a little more may be drawn from <hi>white Tartar,</hi> but it is no better than the other.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved that when <hi>water</hi> is thrown upon the <hi>Maſs</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> newly <hi>Calcined,</hi> it <hi>heats,</hi> much like unſlack't <hi>Lime,</hi> when wetted; the reaſon of which is the ſame that I have given, to explicate the <hi>Ebullition</hi> of <hi>Quick-lime</hi> in <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> all the difference is this, that <hi>Tartar Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined</hi> containing a great deal of <hi>Salt,</hi> does more eaſily imbibe <hi>water</hi> than <hi>Quick-lime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some do <hi>Calcine ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> with a little <hi>ſulphur,</hi> to hinder it from <hi>diſſolving</hi> ſo eaſily by the <hi>Air,</hi> and to <hi>whiten</hi> it the more; but this is no good practice, becauſe the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of <hi>ſulphur</hi> deſtroyes ſome part of the <hi>Alkali;</hi> and this does come to happen, by reaſon that the <hi>Pores</hi> of this <hi>Salt</hi> by being thus <hi>Calcined</hi> are not ſo <hi>open</hi> as they were, and the <hi>Air</hi> therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo eaſily <hi>melt</hi> it. If you would deſire to make <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> and other <hi>Alkali fixt ſalts</hi> very <hi>white</hi> indeed, you muſt <hi>Calcine</hi> them all alone in a great fire, until they become <hi>white,</hi> and then <hi>Purifie</hi> them by <hi>Diſſolation, Filtration,</hi> and <hi>Coagulation.</hi> As for their proneneſs to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55119:66"/>
                  <hi>diſſolve,</hi> this accident is <hi>Natural</hi> to <hi>Alkali ſalts,</hi> and it cannot be taken from them, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their nature.</p>
               <p>Nor can I approve the addition of ſome quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Niter</hi> to the <hi>Calcination</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> as ſome will do, becauſe the <hi>Volatile</hi> parts of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> being <hi>exalted,</hi> the <hi>fixt</hi> do remain, and by their <hi>Acidity</hi> do diminiſh the virtue of <hi>Salt of Tartar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alkali ſalts</hi> are <hi>Aperitive,</hi> in that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve thoſe <hi>ſlimy</hi> humors which cauſed <hi>Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and it is for the ſame reaſon that <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> does <hi>correct Senna,</hi> and hinders it from griping, for the ſubſtance of <hi>Senna</hi> being <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous,</hi> this does <hi>Rarifie</hi> it, and make it work the quicker; it may alſo ſerve to diſſolve ſome <hi>viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Phlegm</hi> that ſticks to the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> which as it is going off, cauſes griping pains.</p>

               </head>
               <p>If you uſe two ounces of <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> in this Operation, you'l draw two ounces and a half of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum.</hi> This <hi>Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> comes from the more heavy and ſtrong part of the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> for the humidity that is Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated is very <hi>Phlegmatick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may here uſe the <hi>Rectified Oyl of Vitriol</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and then the leſs is requir'd, becauſe it is a ſtronger <hi>Acid,</hi> but the <hi>Tartarum
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55119:66"/>Vitriolatum</hi> will not be ſo <hi>white,</hi> as when <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> is uſed, by reaſon of ſome <hi>Tincture</hi> that always remains with <hi>Oyl of Vitriol, Rectifie</hi> it as much as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Though ſome have written, that if <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum</hi> ſhould be put into a <hi>Retort,</hi> and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by fire, one might draw <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> as good as it was at firſt, nevertheleſs 'tis certain 'twill not be ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> a <hi>Spirit;</hi> for it has loſt the moſt <hi>ſubtle</hi> part of its <hi>Acidity,</hi> by encountring with the <hi>Alkali,</hi> which may be eaſily judged both by the <hi>Taſte,</hi> and the <hi>Effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by way of <hi>Curioſity</hi> you would ſearch a little narrowly into this Operation, and obſerve what happens during the <hi>Ebullition</hi> of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali,</hi> you'l find, that a great many little daſhes of water do fly about, eſpecially if the veſſel is not placed too low, and you hold a lighted <hi>Candle</hi> near it, for they will be apt to put it out. This <hi>Effect</hi> can have no other cauſe than the violent ſeparation of the parts of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali</hi> by <hi>Acid,</hi> which makes the watry part of this liquor ſprinkle it ſelf upwards, it being on all ſides furiouſly driven.</p>
               <p>If you uſe <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> the <hi>Ebullition</hi> is the greater, and the <hi>heat</hi> the more conſiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its <hi>Acid</hi> being <hi>ſtronger,</hi> it ſeparates the parts of the <hi>Alkali</hi> body with more eaſe.</p>
               <p>Now conſidering the <hi>Ebullition</hi> which happens between <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali,</hi> I have the leſs opinion of a <hi>Method</hi> that ſome follow, which is to bathe a little the bodies that are to be <hi>Embalmed,</hi> with <hi>Spirit of ſalt,</hi> and then to put <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55119:67"/>into the <hi>Embalming Powder;</hi> for it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this <hi>Spirit of Salt,</hi> which is an <hi>Acid,</hi> by mixing with the <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a <hi>Fermentation</hi> which may ſtir up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining humidity of the Carkaſs, and make it enter into the <hi>Ingredients</hi> of the <hi>Powder,</hi> and ſo inſtead of <hi>Preſerving</hi> the dead body intire, we may have reaſon to fear leſt this <hi>Fermentation</hi> ſhould rather haſten the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of its parts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Leaven</hi> does encreaſe the <hi>Fermentation</hi> in <hi>Dough,</hi> as being a <hi>Paſte</hi> it ſelf, whoſe <hi>ſalts</hi> are made free by a long <hi>Fermentation;</hi> theſe <hi>ſalts</hi> do joyn with thoſe of the other <hi>Paſte,</hi> and aſſiſt them both to rarifie and diſſolve.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing may be ſaid of divers other <hi>Acids</hi> which do cauſe a <hi>Fermentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Acids</hi> have <hi>rarified</hi> the matter as much as they can, they there loſe their motion, and then there happens a kind of <hi>Coagulation,</hi> that is to ſay, the matter returns into its firſt dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>Again there is one effect of <hi>Acids,</hi> which ſeems different from thoſe I mentioned before, and it is that they can <hi>preſerve</hi> certain bodies that are put into them, as <hi>ſalt</hi> preſerves <hi>meat.</hi> Thus when young <hi>Cucumbers, Saxifrage, Capers, &amp;c.</hi> are ſet a ſteeping in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> there happens no <hi>Fermentation</hi> at all, and conſequently no <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55119:67"/>
               <p>The reaſon of which is, that the parts of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers,</hi> and other things I mentioned, being of a <hi>viſcous</hi> nature, the <hi>Acids</hi> do inſinuate into them for to diſſolve them, but they have not motion there free enough to make their attacks, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the parts, ſo that the <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Vinegar</hi> does only fix it ſelf in the Pores of theſe bodies, and there <hi>Coagulate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is this <hi>Coagulation</hi> that hinders the <hi>Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> from <hi>corrupting,</hi> for theſe <hi>Acids</hi> do ſtop up their <hi>Pores</hi> and ſerve as ſo many little <hi>Peggs,</hi> to keep the parts firm and quiet. <hi>Sea-ſalt</hi> which is an <hi>Acid</hi> does preſerve meat, and ſeveral other things for the ſame reaſon; but I have ſpoken ſomething of that in the <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>

               <head>Add to <hi>pag.</hi> 276. the end of the ſame <hi>Remarks.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Another <hi>Objection</hi> may be made to what I have ſaid touching <hi>Digeſtion;</hi> it is, that whereas I maintained that <hi>Acids</hi> do <hi>Diſſolve</hi> when they <hi>abound,</hi> and <hi>Coagulate</hi> when there are but <hi>few</hi> in a great deal of matter, it ſhould happen that <hi>Spittle</hi> ſhould then be apter to <hi>Coagulate</hi> the <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> and cauſe <hi>indigeſtion,</hi> than would a greater quantity of <hi>Acids,</hi> for it ſeems, according to my <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> the more <hi>acids</hi> are found in a matter, the more liable it muſt be to <hi>diſſolve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To reſolve this difficulty, which ſeems to be very conſiderable, we muſt obſerve, that the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55119:68"/>
                  <hi>natural acids</hi> of <hi>Aliments</hi> taken into the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> are ſufficient to <hi>rarifie</hi> and <hi>diſſolve</hi> thoſe bodies which hinder their motion, when they have been ſtirr'd up by <hi>Maſtication,</hi> or by ſome <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>ſpittle,</hi> which ſerves as a <hi>Leaven</hi> to them, much after the ſame manner as the <hi>ſalts of Meal</hi> do <hi>rarifie</hi> the <hi>Paſte,</hi> when they are actuated by means of <hi>Trituration</hi> and <hi>Leaven</hi> together; but now if there happens to be too much <hi>acid</hi> in the <hi>Aliments</hi> that are taken into the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> they will have the ſame effect as <hi>Cucumbers</hi> and thoſe other things I mentioned, which <hi>preſerve</hi> in <hi>Vinegar.</hi> The <hi>acids</hi> will indeed endeavour to cut in pieces what ſtands in their way, but having to do with parts too viſcous and heavy, they will ſoon loſe all their motion, and fix by their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and by their gravity the <hi>natural ſalt</hi> of theſe <hi>aliments,</hi> as <hi>Vinegar</hi> fixes that of <hi>Cucumbers;</hi> for whereas the <hi>acids</hi> do ſhut the <hi>Pores</hi> of the matter, and keep them firm and quiet, the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſalt</hi> can't be able to <hi>exalt</hi> ſo as to cauſe <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> or <hi>Digeſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon then why a ſmall portion of <hi>acids</hi> will cauſe <hi>Digeſtion</hi> in the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> and a greater quantity will hinder it, is that the ſmall quantity will joyn with the <hi>natural ſalt</hi> of <hi>aliments,</hi> and have its operation without ſtopping the <hi>Pores</hi> of the matter, whereas a great ſtore of <hi>acids</hi> will quite ſtop up the <hi>Pores</hi> of this ſame matter, and hinder the motion of the <hi>natural ſalt;</hi> for it is not enough that there are a great many <hi>acids,</hi> to cauſe a <hi>diſſolution,</hi> theſe <hi>acids</hi> muſt have room to move in, and make their attacks.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55119:68"/>
               <p>Thus theſe <hi>Effects</hi> make nothing againſt what I aſſerted concerning <hi>acids,</hi> for a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them will always have more diſpoſition, and tendency to a <hi>diſſolution;</hi> but if this great quantity does <hi>Coagulate</hi> divers things, it is only by accident, and by reaſon of the diſpoſition of the matter into which the <hi>acid</hi> points do uſe to enter.</p>
               <p>What I have eſtabliſhed concerning <hi>acids</hi> may ſerve very much towards the explicating of <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and their principal <hi>ſymptoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt of all every body muſt grant, that when there are <hi>Obſtructions</hi> in our Bodies, the <hi>obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> matter does <hi>Ferment</hi> and <hi>ſowr,</hi> as <hi>Dough, Wine,</hi> and ſeveral other things grow <hi>ſowr</hi> by being <hi>ſtale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This matter by <hi>Fermenting</hi> ſends <hi>ſalt</hi> or <hi>acid</hi> vapours into the <hi>Maſs</hi> of <hi>Bloud,</hi> which do cauſe diverſe Alterations in it, according to their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and quality, for theſe <hi>acids</hi> are commonly mixt with <hi>ſulphurs,</hi> which are a kind of Vehicle to the <hi>acids,</hi> and are more or leſs <hi>corrupted,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the matter whence they are derived have ſojourned more or leſs in the <hi>Obſtructed</hi> part.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe <hi>acid vapours</hi> are carried into the <hi>Veſſels,</hi> but only in ſuch a quantity as is fit to make a kind of <hi>Leaven</hi> in the <hi>Bloud,</hi> they will then <hi>rarifie</hi> the <hi>Bloud</hi> too much, and whereas they by conſequence encreaſe its <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> they do cauſe that which we call a <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> this <hi>Feaver</hi> muſt remain as long as the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> continues in the <hi>Bloud,</hi> and according as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55119:69"/>there comes a new ſupply of matter in place of what nature has thrown off.</p>
               <p>But if a greater quantity of <hi>acids</hi> riſes all of a ſudden from out of the <hi>Obſtructions,</hi> then there muſt needs happen a kind of <hi>Coagulation,</hi> for theſe <hi>acids</hi> thus abounding, and fixing the groſſer part of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> do partly loſe their motion, and quiet the <hi>Ebullition</hi> of the <hi>Bloud</hi> by fixing its parts.</p>
               <p>It is this kind of Congelation which cauſes thoſe Cold Shiverings, which are felt, before the Hot Fit begins; for as the Heat is derived from the motion of the Spirits, the Cold is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the ceſſation of their motion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cold fit</hi> continues until the <hi>Spirits</hi> have by their activity <hi>rarified</hi> this <hi>Congelation;</hi> for the <hi>Spirits</hi> being continually ſupplied with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional forces do violently aſſault the paſſage 'till they have broke it open, and made their way free.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Coagulum</hi> being <hi>diſſolved,</hi> the <hi>Bloud</hi> ſhould ſeem to <hi>Circulate</hi> as it did before, but becauſe the matter of the <hi>Coagulum</hi> is converted into a <hi>Leaven,</hi> this <hi>Leaven</hi> makes the <hi>Bloud</hi> to <hi>Boil,</hi> and ſo cauſes a <hi>Feaver;</hi> this <hi>Feaver</hi> continues until the <hi>Bloud</hi> is freed from all this <hi>Ferment,</hi> either by <hi>Transpiration,</hi> or by way of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to conceive how this <hi>Coagulum</hi> may be converted into a <hi>Leaven,</hi> we muſt conſider that the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Bloud</hi> have loſt moſt of their <hi>aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> in <hi>diſſolving</hi> this <hi>Coagulum,</hi> and that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but only <hi>acidity</hi> enough to produce a <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:55119:69"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſs you muſt not think I mean by this <hi>Congelation</hi> now ſpoken of, a <hi>Coagulum</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together like unto that in <hi>Milk,</hi> or to that which happens, when an <hi>acid</hi> liquor is <hi>ſying'd</hi> into the <hi>Veins</hi> of an <hi>Animal,</hi> for theſe <hi>Congelations</hi> are too ſtrong, and there would then happen to us the ſame thing, or very near the ſame as does to the <hi>animal,</hi> who ſoon afterwards falls into <hi>Convulſions,</hi> and <hi>dies,</hi> becauſe the courſe of the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> would be intirely ſtopt, and they would never be able to break through ſo great an obſtacle: but I underſtand here that the <hi>Bloud</hi> is made thicker than it was, and has not ſo free a motion as it had before, which is enough to cauſe ſuch <hi>cold Fits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there remains for me to explicate how it comes to paſs that <hi>Feavers</hi> have their abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and returns regularly by <hi>Fits.</hi>

               <p>The matter that makes the <hi>Obstructions</hi> which I have laid down for the <hi>Fundamental Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Feavers,</hi> begins not to ſend out its vapours, nor diſperſes its <hi>acid ſalt</hi> into the <hi>Bloud</hi> in order to cauſe a <hi>Feaver,</hi> until it has got together a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain quantity in the <hi>obſtructed</hi> veſſels, and then it is probable there is a kind of <hi>Eruption</hi> of the matter.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Eruption</hi> of <hi>Feaveriſh</hi> matter muſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at ſet times, ſo long as the <hi>Obſtruction</hi> laſts, becauſe the humors which <hi>Circulate</hi> to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed</hi> parts, and there ſtop, are alwayes in an equal quickneſs and quantity.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing that in a <hi>Tertian Ague,</hi> the veſſels wherein the <hi>obſtruction happens,</hi> do acquire in two
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55119:70"/>dayes time a ſufficient repletion of matter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Eruption</hi> and <hi>Fermentation</hi> I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, the <hi>Fits</hi> do come to operate every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day.</p>
               <p>But becauſe in a <hi>Quartan Ague</hi> the humors are more tenacious and heavy, and flow with expedition, the <hi>Fermentation</hi> and <hi>Eruption</hi> muſt needs be ſlower and conſequently the <hi>Fits</hi> more diſtant the one from the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Quotidian Ague</hi> is cauſed by a <hi>Salt Pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> which is naturally fluid enough to make the matter <hi>ferment</hi> in leſs time, wherefore it is that the <hi>Fits</hi> do return every day.</p>
               <p>We may reaſon concerning the other kinds of <hi>Feavers</hi> upon the ſame <hi>Principle,</hi> and explicate all the accidents that happen, but I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to enlarge my ſelf further upon this ſubject, I ſhould think it would be too great a <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> and a Book might rather be made on purpoſe, to expreſs all the circumſtances which might be deduced from it.</p>

                  <head>Remarks.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Lees</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> being incomparably more <hi>Fermented</hi> than the <hi>Tartar</hi> which is found in the ſides of Veſſels, we need not wonder if its <hi>ſalt</hi> is more <hi>Volatile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>ſalt</hi> is <hi>ſublimed</hi> in a <hi>Boulthead</hi> with a long neck, to the end the <hi>Phlegm,</hi> which is too heavy to riſe eaſily ſo high, may not much mix with it; but it is extraordinary hard to keep this <hi>ſalt dry,</hi> it eaſily humects and diſſolves into liquor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were much better to draw it in a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and leſs of the <hi>Volatile</hi> part would be loſt, being detained by <hi>Phlegm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs becauſe there are ſeveral perſons who are as well pleaſed with the <hi>ſight</hi> of things, as their <hi>Effects,</hi> this <hi>liquified ſalt</hi> might be mixt with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Calcined Bones</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, to make thereof a <hi>Paſte,</hi> which might be made into little <hi>Pellets,</hi> to be put into a <hi>Boult-head,</hi> and fitting to it a <hi>Blind head,</hi> this <hi>ſalt</hi> may be <hi>ſublimed</hi> or <hi>Rectified</hi> as before, and this pure <hi>ſalt</hi> muſt be kept in Viols well ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty there is in keeping this <hi>Volatile ſalt dry,</hi> as well as that of other <hi>Vegetables,</hi> does proceed from this, that only the more <hi>Eſſential</hi> part is <hi>Volatilized,</hi> for there remains much <hi>fixt ſalt</hi> with the <hi>earth</hi> in the <hi>Retort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> becomes <hi>Alkali</hi> by the means of fire, as the other <hi>Volatile ſalts</hi> do, whereof I have already ſpoken in my <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Principles;</hi> and there is no manner of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55119:71"/>that it ſhould have been of this nature, either in the <hi>Plant</hi> or in the <hi>Lees,</hi> for the reaſons that I have ſhewn in the ſame <hi>Remarks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall add here, that if the <hi>Alkali ſalt</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in the <hi>Lees,</hi> but is not able to unfold it ſelf, and get the predominancy of <hi>Acids</hi> but only by a long <hi>Fermentation,</hi> as the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> will have it, who follow the common way of diſcourſing of theſe things, it would then neceſſarily follow that the more <hi>Lees</hi> do <hi>Ferment,</hi> the more they muſt loſe of their <hi>Acidity,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Alkali</hi> would deſtroy it. Nevertheleſs the contrary to this happens; for <hi>Lees</hi> do <hi>ſowr</hi> as they grow <hi>ſtale,</hi> and thoſe who make your <hi>Vinegar,</hi> do know well enough how to uſe <hi>Lees,</hi> and make them <hi>Ferment</hi> with their <hi>Wine,</hi> when they would uſe a quick diſpatch in making <hi>Vinegar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me from the conſideration of this effect, that there is little reaſon to follow the Sentiments of ſome, who have writ that the <hi>Lees</hi> of <hi>wine</hi> abounding in <hi>Volatile ſalt,</hi> and a <hi>ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous ſpirit</hi> do contain but very little <hi>Acid;</hi> for it is as plain as may be that this <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> is <hi>Acid</hi> in the <hi>Lees,</hi> and is the fame that makes the <hi>Acid ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> as being more <hi>Volatile</hi> than many other <hi>Acids,</hi> to <hi>Volatilize</hi> along with its <hi>Phlegm</hi> in the <hi>diſtillation.</hi> It is true that <hi>ſalt of Tartar</hi> drawn by the <hi>Retort,</hi> does riſe more eaſily than the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> but this is from its being <hi>Volatilized</hi> by the violent heat of fire.</p>
                  <p>Another mark that all the <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Lees</hi> is <hi>Acid,</hi> is this, that the <hi>Tartar</hi> does all <hi>diſſolve</hi> in the <hi>wine,</hi> and turns into <hi>Vinegar;</hi> for very little or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55119:72"/>no <hi>Lees,</hi> or other <hi>Tartar,</hi> is to be found in the <hi>Barrels</hi> wherein <hi>Vinegar</hi> was made, although there was ſome before as nature made it, or though ſome other was added to it.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be <hi>Objected,</hi> that <hi>Lees</hi> are ſometimes added to <hi>Wines</hi> grown ropy and muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous to make them good again, and thoſe <hi>Wines</hi> are not ſowred by the <hi>Lees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this effect happens, when the former <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> becoming <hi>imperfect,</hi> through the too great quantity of <hi>Phlegm</hi> for the little proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Salt</hi> that was in the <hi>wines,</hi> the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>Lees</hi> does <hi>rarifie,</hi> exalt, and involve it ſelf in ſome meaſure in the <hi>Oyly</hi> parts of the liquor that the <hi>wine</hi> is made of, as I have ſaid in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Wine</hi> does not ſowr, ſo long as the <hi>ſalt</hi> finds <hi>Oyl</hi> to act upon, but it does ſo, when this <hi>ſalt</hi> finds nothing to hinder it from ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> produces much the ſame effects, as that of <hi>Beans,</hi> and other <hi>ſeeds,</hi> and though many will needs give it ſuch ſublime and extraordinary virtues in compariſon with other <hi>Volatile ſalts,</hi> I do'nt ſee any reaſon for ſuch high fancies, nor that <hi>effects</hi> do anſwer their <hi>Pretences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Volatile ſalts</hi> have a good uſe, when they find the <hi>Pores</hi> and <hi>Humors</hi> diſpoſed for <hi>Tranſpiration,</hi> but they are full as dangerous, when the <hi>Humors</hi> are not at all <hi>Prepared;</hi> for by their <hi>Volatility</hi> they do ſo ſtir them up, that oftentimes the <hi>Feaver</hi> is known to be encreaſed by them, and tranſlated
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55119:72"/>to the <hi>Brain:</hi> wherefore you muſt be ſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well the <hi>Temper</hi> and preſent ſtate of your Patient, before you preſume to give them.</p>
                  <p>That which remains in the <hi>Boulthead,</hi> after the <hi>Volatile ſalt,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> are drawn off, is a black and ſtinking <hi>Oyl</hi> mixt with the more <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi> part of the liquor; you muſt ſeparate this <hi>Oyl</hi> in a <hi>Funnel</hi> lined with brown paper; it is good for the <hi>Palſie, Cold pains,</hi> and for <hi>Hyſterick</hi> women to ſmell to.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Lee</hi> or <hi>Calcined Tartar</hi> is found in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,</hi> out of which you may draw a <hi>fixt Alkali ſalt,</hi> as out of common <hi>Tartar,</hi> but in a leſſer quantity, for that the greateſt part of the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Lees</hi> is <hi>Volatilized.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>Some have writ in oppoſition to what I have eſtabliſh'd on this ſubject, and ſay, that if we have regard to the quantity of <hi>Narcotick vapours</hi> that may ariſe from a <hi>ſmall Doſe</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> it ought not to be imagined that thoſe <hi>Vapours</hi> ſhould be able to ſhut the channels of the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>humours</hi> which make a <hi>defluxion</hi> upon ſome part; but that we ſhould rather conclude the <hi>mitigation</hi> of <hi>pains,</hi> and <hi>ſtopping</hi> of <hi>defluxions</hi> to proceed from a juſ proportion of the <hi>ſalt</hi> and <hi>ſulphur</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> and from the <hi>ſecret Ferment</hi> they contain.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Objection</hi> will give us but little trouble in the anſwering, when we conſider that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Vapours</hi> cauſed by it are but few, yet the veſſels of the <hi>Brain,</hi> in which the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> do move, are exceeding delicate, and eaſie to be obſtructed; and that the too great activity of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> which often fly into the diſeaſed parts, being thus abated by the <hi>viſcous</hi> nature of <hi>Opium,</hi> there muſt needs follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome eaſe and comfort, without any need at all of admitting a <hi>ſtoppage</hi> of the <hi>Veſſels.</hi> And again we may conceive, that all the <hi>Opium</hi> that was taken, being capable of being <hi>Rarified</hi> into <hi>vapours</hi> by the <hi>heat</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> there muſt needs be produced good quantity of them.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:55119:73"/>
               <p>As for the proportion of <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> in <hi>Opium,</hi> and the <hi>ſecret Ferment</hi> they pretend to acquaint us with, in order to <hi>Explicate</hi> this matter, I know they are high terms indeed, but illuſtrate very little; for though they ſay theſe <hi>ſalts</hi> and <hi>ſulphurs</hi> do unite with <hi>Homogeneous</hi> particles that they meet with, and deſtroy ſuch as are the cauſe of the Diſtemper, we can never by this means receive any clear <hi>Idea</hi> of that which makes <hi>Opium ſoporiferous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the virtue which <hi>Opium</hi> has to cauſe <hi>ſleep,</hi> I have obſerved that it is often <hi>Sudorifick.</hi> I conceive this effect muſt not be attributed only to the <hi>Volatile</hi> parts of this mixt, which may be thought to operate this way, after they are diſingaged from its <hi>viſcoſity,</hi> but rather to this, that during <hi>ſleep,</hi> the inward veſſels being as it were <hi>obſtructed,</hi> or in ſome manner <hi>Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits</hi> finding reſiſtance in their paſſage, do <hi>reflect,</hi> or turn their motion to the outward parts, and draw along with 'em ſome <hi>moiſture</hi> through the <hi>Pores.</hi> That which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms me in this opinion is the conſideration, that divers perſons do uſe always to <hi>ſweat,</hi> when they are a ſleep, though they have not taken any <hi>Opium</hi> at all. Now it may happen that in the operation of <hi>Opium,</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> finding more reſiſtance within than they are wont, may tend outwards with the more force, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently incline to <hi>ſweat</hi> more than in <hi>natural ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some prejudiced <hi>Chymiſt</hi> may not reliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this my <hi>Explication,</hi> becauſe I don't <hi>ſeaſon</hi>

               <p>The third is, becauſe <hi>ſpirit of wine</hi> is not ſo convenient a <hi>menſtruum</hi> to diſſolve the <hi>ſalts</hi> which the <hi>Ingredients</hi> we uſe are full of, and it is in this <hi>ſalt,</hi> that their greareſt <hi>virtue</hi> does conſiſt.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:55119:75"/>
               <p>Wherefore we ought to chooſe ſuch <hi>diſſolvents,</hi> as beſt preſerve the virtue of <hi>mixt</hi> bodies, and ſuch as are <hi>familiar</hi> to our nature. We muſt uſe <hi>Spirit of wine</hi> to <hi>extract Roſines,</hi> ſuch as that of <hi>Scammony, Jalap, Turbith;</hi> but whenever an <hi>Extract</hi> can be drawn with a <hi>watry menſtruum,</hi> it is better to uſe that, rather than another, for the reaſons I have mentioned.</p>

               <p>I am apt to conceive, that the <hi>Venom</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> is cauſed by an affluence of <hi>Acid ſalts,</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently thrown forth, and which by inſinuating into the <hi>Veins,</hi> do by degrees cauſe a <hi>Coagulum</hi> in the <hi>Bloud,</hi> to hinder its <hi>Circulation,</hi> and the <hi>courſe</hi> of the <hi>ſpirits;</hi> this opinion is the more probable, in that <hi>Coagulated Bloud</hi> has been found in the <hi>Veins</hi> of many <hi>Animals,</hi> which have been <hi>bit</hi> by the <hi>Viper,</hi> and beſides the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Remedies</hi> that cure this <hi>Poiſon,</hi> are <hi>Volatile Alkali ſalts,</hi> which are proper to diſſolve the <hi>Coagulum.</hi>

               <p>As for what may be ſaid, that if this diſcourſe were true, the <hi>Natural acidity</hi> of the <hi>Bloud</hi> would <hi>Coagulate</hi> it ſometimes, as it happens to <hi>Milk</hi> which <hi>Curdles</hi> of it ſelf; and that this <hi>Coagulation</hi> would produce the ſame effects as does the <hi>Venom</hi> of <hi>Vipers;</hi> this <hi>Objection</hi> raiſes no difficulty at all.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spirit of Wax</hi> is only a ſmall quantity of <hi>Acid Volatile ſalt</hi> diſſolved in Phlegm; but you muſt not believe what ſome have written, that having <hi>Diſtilled</hi> a conſiderable quantity of <hi>Wax,</hi> and put that which was drawn into a <hi>Boult head</hi> with a long neck, they could <hi>ſublime</hi> the <hi>Volatile ſalt</hi> like others of that nature. For this <hi>ſalt,</hi> though it is indeed <hi>Volatile,</hi> yet it is not <hi>Volatile</hi> enough to riſe before the <hi>Phlegm;</hi> it is an <hi>Acid ſalt</hi> much like unto that of <hi>Amber,</hi> but is not of the nature of <hi>Volatile Alkali's,</hi> which are known to <hi>ſublime</hi> ſo eaſily; it were better therefore to keep this <hi>ſpirit</hi> as it is, or elſe to evaporate about half of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55119:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>it with a very mild heat, that it may be the ſtronger.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Volatile ſalts</hi> of many <hi>ſulphureous</hi> matters are drawn <hi>Acid,</hi> as they were <hi>de facto</hi> in the <hi>mixt,</hi> becauſe being cloathed with <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> parts which give way eaſily to their motion, they do not break their natural keenneſs in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſeparate, when they are forced by fire, and ſo they do not receive ſo much <hi>terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious</hi> and <hi>fiery</hi> matter, as is requiſite to make them <hi>Porous,</hi> like <hi>Volatile Alkali's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks this <hi>Operation,</hi> and the <hi>Diſtillation</hi> of <hi>Amber</hi> which I have deſcribed, do much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I ſaid before in my <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Principles,</hi> that all the <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>mixt</hi> bodies is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally <hi>Acid,</hi> and that <hi>Alkali</hi> is nothing elſe but a <hi>mutation made by fire.</hi> Beſides, all ſorts of <hi>Experiments</hi> do ſeem to me to confirm and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this Opinion; but yet I am not ſo perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory in the vindication of it, but would gladly give place to another, if I could be ſhewed that it is better than mine, for I ſeek after nothing elſe but real <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither would I have it thought, I am ſo full of <hi>Vanity,</hi> as to <hi>vaunt</hi> my ſelf for the <hi>firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of this <hi>Opinion,</hi> of many other thoughts, and of all the wayes of <hi>Operation</hi> that are to be found in my <hi>Book,</hi> as if for certain they were never writ before; for although I can aſſure my <hi>Reader,</hi> that they are dictates of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and that I have not ſearched into any <hi>Author</hi> whatſoever to find them out; it may have hapned nevertheleſs, and I am willing to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55119:79"/>think ſo, that many others beſides my ſelf may have thought and written the ſame things that I have done, and with <hi>more order</hi> and <hi>decorum.</hi> All the <hi>glory</hi> therefore that I am deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve unto my ſelf, upon this occaſion, is, that I have had the fortune to fall into the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, as many <hi>Ingenious</hi> perſons have done before me, without <hi>conſulting</hi> any of them.</p>
